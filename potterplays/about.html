        <h3>Why did you choose this project?</h3>
        <p> I chose thise project because growing up, reading has always been a major part of my life. No matter where I went, there was always a book in my hands. The Harry Potter series was one of those series that could never get old. Once I entered college and discovered the fascinating world of coding, it has been a goal to conduct and execute research on the series to not only gain a deeper understanding and discover the meaning behind various choices, but also to give tribute to one of the most influential series in my life. </p>
