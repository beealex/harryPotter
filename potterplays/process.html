Additionally, there were a few entire pages missing from the stages of OCR on the pdf file to                       the conversion of the text file.</li>

               <li>Character speech scrapers were constructed in Exist (Malfoys, Weasleys, Harry, Hermione, Filch & Figg) to ensure that there is a representation of all “social” classes in the films.</li>
