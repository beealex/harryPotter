        <h2>Project Description</h2>
        <p>At PotterPlays we seek to analyze the open source screenplays of the magical series <i>Harry Potter</i>. </p>
        <p> The goal of the project is to conduct word analysis on all 8 of the <i>Harry Potter</i> screenplays to discover how gender is represented through the scriptwriter's diction.  </p>
        <h2>Project Plans</h2>
         <h3>***Still in the planning stages. Subject to change. ***</h3>
        <ul>
         <li>Conduct OCR on the PDFs of the screenplays and convert to .txt files.</li>
         <li>Research the role of gender in the open source screenplays.</li>
         <li>Research the infamous gender tweets relating to gender in the series.</li>
         <li>Utilize Antconc to pull out phrases and how many times they are mentioned. This can be used to analyze various characters and their gender role/description.</li>
         <li>Potentially develop a personography and/or character mentions</li>
         <li>Incorporate important timeline of events (book releases, production dates, movie releases)</li>
        </ul>
