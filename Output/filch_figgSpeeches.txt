Students out of bed! Students in the corridors!
Oh. Sorry, mum.
Right away.
Er, exactly where is it I’d be leadin’ em to, mum?
Night-tee night.
And what exactly would you be wanting with a walking stick?
Professor Slughorn, sir! I’ve just discovered this boy lurking in an upstairs corridor. He claims to have been invited to your party.
Well, take a good look, lads...

This night might well be the last you spend in this castle.
What's going on here? Go on now! Make way...
Mrs. Norris!
You! You've murdered my cat! I'll kill you! I'll --

Ask him! It's him that's done it. You saw what he wrote on the wall! Besides, he knows I'm -- I'm a Squib.
Rubbish! He saw my Kwikspell letter!
My cat has been Petrified! I want to see some punishment!
Caught in the act. I'll have you out this time, Potter. Mark my words...

Dark magic. That's what you've got, Potter. Even the air you breathe comes out poison. You're evil. Evil as they come...
Right, Potter. I'll have what you're sending.
I have had a tip-off that you are ordering a large quantity of Dungbombs! Now hand it over.
I get a single whiff of a Dungbomb in this castle, Potter...and you're mine. He turns and departs.
Professor! It's those Weasley twins! They've set something off in the Astronomy Tower! Umbridge smiles twistedly.
They've had this coming for a long time!
I've got you now!
There'll be no need for ghosts, Professor...
Who goes there!
Lead me to them, my sweet....
Professors... I found this. In the Restricted Section. It's still hot.
A pity they let the old punishments die. Was a time, detention would find you all hanging by your thumbs in the dungeons...
A sorry lot this, Hagrid. I pity you.
Good god, man, you're not still on about that bloody dragon, are you?
For god's sake, pull yourself together, man. You're going into the Forest, after all. Got to have your wits about you.

Oh, there's more'n werewolves in those trees, lad. You can be sure o' that.
You boys go home now, or I'll be calling your parents! They pause and edge away from Harry.
