 What did you put on me? 
 A Stinging Jinx. 
 How long will it last? 
 Not long. 
 Show me. 
 Get Draco. 
 Why Draco? 
 Just sit back and watch, Lucius. Hm? Pour yourself another glass
                of wine. 
 Where’d you find them? 
 In the North Forest. 
 Lovely scarf, Scabior. Though I’m not sure it’s your color. 
 It’s not mine. 
 You don’t say. 
 Fancy her, do you, Scabior? Can’t say I blame you. Maybe we’ll
                workout a little reward for you, hm? That is, assuming all is as it appears. Ah,
                Draco. Come here, darling. 
 My friends here say they’ve got Harry Potter. Seeing as he’s an
                old school chum of yours, I thought you could confirm the fact for us. 
 Well...? 
 I can’t... I can’t be sure. 
 Look close, Draco. If we’re the ones who hand Potter over to the Dark
                Lord, everything will be forgiven. Do you understand -
 Now, we won’t be forgetting who
                actually caught him, I hope, Mr. Malfoy? 
 Of course not. 
 Narcissa. Tend to
                your husband. Lucius staggers back nervously next to his wife. 

                
 Don’t be shy, sweetheart. Get up nice and close.
 What’s wrong with his face? 
 What is wrong with his face, Scabior? 
 He came to us that way. I reckon he picked it up in the forest. 
 Or ran into a Stinging Jinx. 
 Was it you, dearie? Give me her wand. We’ll see what the last
                spell was. 
 What is that? 
 Where did you get that! 
 It was in her bag when we searched her. Reckon it’s mine now. 
 Are you mad! 
 How dare you! Release me, woman! 
 Go. GO! 
 Wormtail. Put these two in the cellar. I want to have a little
                conversation with this one. Girl to girl. 
 Harry! What’re we going to do? We can’t just leave Hermione alone with
                her! 
 Ron? Harry...? 
 Luna...? 
 This sword is meant to be in my vault at Gringotts. How did you
                get it? 
 I don’t know what you’re talking about.
 Liar. What else did you take? 
 You look strange, Harry. Mr. Ollivander, look who’s here. It’s Harry
                Potter.
 Hello, sir. 
 I’m going to ask you once again: what else did
                you and your friends take from my vault! 
 I told you. I don’t know what you’re talking
                -Hermione SCREAMS in pain. wall, turns. Ron slams his fist against the 
 We have to do something, Harry! 
 There’s no way out. We’ve tried everything. 
 You’re bleeding, Harry. 
 That’s a curious thing to hide in your sock. 
 You were hiding it, weren’t you? 
 Help us. 
 Let her go! Let her go! 
 Shut it! You. Goblin. Come with me. 
 Dobby. What’re you doing here? 
 Dobby has come to rescue HarryPotter, of course. 
 Do you mean to say you can Apparate in and out of here? And take us
                with you? 
 Of course. I’m an elf. 
 Works for me. 
 Right. Dobby, I want you to takeLuna and Mr. Ollivander to -
 Shell Cottage on the outskirts of Tinworth. 
 Trust me. 
 You’ll see to Mr. Ollivander? 
 Of course. 
 Whenever you’re ready, sir.
 Like her very much. 
 Meet me at the top
                of the stairs in ten seconds.
 Who gets his wand? 
 Sss.
 Well? 
 I left Gringotts employ many weeks ago, but when I was last in your
                vault, the sword was there. 
 Perhaps it just walked out on its own then. 
 There is no place safer than Gringotts, Madam LeStrange. 
 Liar! You can’t deceive me! 
 Consider yourself lucky, Goblin. The same won’t be said for this
                one. 
 Like hell! 
 Expelliarmus! 
 Stupefy! 
 Stop or she dies! 
 Drop your wands. Ron stands rigidly, staring balefully at
                Bellatrix. 
 I said drop them! 

                
 All right!
 Pick them up, Draco. Now! Well, well, look what we have here.
                Harry Potter. All bright, shiny and new again. Just in time for the Dark Lord. 
 Call him, Draco.
 Stupefy! 
 You dirty little monkey! You could have killed me! 
 Dobby meant only to maim or seriously injure, not kill. 
 For God’s sake, Cissy, you’ve got a wand! Use it! 
 How dare you take a witch’s wand. How dare you defy your masters. 
 Dobby has no master! Dobby is a free elf, and Dobby has come to save
                Harry Potter and his friends! 
 Give the Dark Lord our regards.
 It’s all right, Hermione. You’re safe. We’re all safe. 
 Dobby... no... 
 It’s okay... Here... Just hold on, Dobby... I’ll fix you -- Hermione--
                your bag --you must have something -- Essence of Dittany -- something... Hermione!
                Help me! 
 Such a beautiful night... to be with friends. Dobby is happy... to be
                with his friend... Harry Potter...
 Fleur’s seeing to Ollivander. Anyone else need tending -
 We should close his eyes. Don’t you think? 
 There. Now he could be sleeping. 
 Harry. It’s all right. That it hurts. That’s what reminds us how lucky
                we are to be alive. 
 I want to bury him properly. Without magic. 
 It’s beautiful here. 
 It was our Aunt’s. We used to come here as kids. The Order uses it now
                as a safe house -- what’s left of us, at least. 
 Muggles think these keep evil away. But they’re wrong... 
 I need to talk to the goblin.
 How are you? 
 Alive. 
 You probably don’t remember -
 -- that I showed you to your vault the first time you visited
                Gringotts? Even amongst goblins, you are famous, Harry Potter. 
 You buried the elf. I saw you. 
 Yes. 
 And brought me here. 
 You are a very unusual wizard. 
 Why did you leave Gringotts? 
 Soon the Death Eaters will control it. That was unacceptable to me. 
 Then you’re on our side. 
 This is a wizard’s war. I take no side. 
 I need to get inside Gringotts, into one of the vaults. 
 It is impossible. 
 Alone, yes. With you, no. 
 How did you come by this sword? 
 It’s complicated. Why did Bellatrix Lestrange think it should be in
                her vault at Gringotts? 
 It’s complicated. 
 The sword presented itself to us in a moment of need. We didn’t steal
                it. 
 There is a sword in Madam Lestrange’s vault identical to this one,
                but it is a fake. It was placed there this past summer. 
 And she never suspected? 
 The replica is very convincing. Only a goblin would recognize that
                this is the true Sword of Gryffindor. 
 Who put it there? The fake. 
 It was not my place to ask, nor did I desire to. There are more
                than a few curious things in the vaults at Gringotts. 
 And in Madam Lestrange’s vault as well? 
 Perhaps. 
 I have gold. Lots of it. 
 I have no interest in gold. Then what?
 The goblin twists the curl at his chin... then his eyes drift once
                again to the sword. Harry starts to respond, but the goblin cuts him off with
                finality. 
 That is my price. 
 All right.
 I have your word, Harry Potter, that you will give me the Sword of
                Gryffindor if I help you? Griphook extends his hand. Harry reaches out, takes it.
            
 Harry, are you thinking there’s a Horcrux in Bellatrix’s vault? 
 She was terrified when she thought we’d been in there. She kept asking
                you what else we’d taken. I’d bet anything there’s a Horcrux there. If we find it,
                we can kill it. And if we kill it, we’re one step closer to killing him. 
 And if we find one? How’re we supposed to destroy it if we’ve given
                Griphook the sword? 
 I’m still working on that part. FLEUR exits the room ahead, a
                half-empty bowl in hand. Seeing Harry, she stops, effectively barring the door. 
 He’s too weak. 
 Forgive me if I don’t get up. 
 Mr. Ollivander, I need to ask you a few questions. 
 Anything, m’boy, anything. 
 Can you identify these, sir? 
 Walnut and dragon heartstring. Twelve and three quarter inches.
                Unyielding. This belongs to Bellatrix Lestrange. 
 And this? 
 Hawthorn. Unicorn hair. Ten inches. Reasonably pliant. This was
                the wand of Draco Malfoy. 
 Was? Isn’t it still? 
 Perhaps not -- if you won it from him. I sense its allegiance has
                changed. 
 You talk about wands like they’ve got feelings. Can think. 
 The wand chooses the wizard, Mr. Potter. That much has always
                been clear to those of us who have studied wandlore. 
 What do you know about the Deathly Hallows, sir? 
 There are rumored to be three: The Elder Wand, the Resurrection
                Stone and the Invisibility Cloak. It is said that to possess the mall is to make
                oneself the Master of Death. But few truly believe such objects exist -
 But you, sir? Do you believe they exist? 
 I see no reason to put stock in an old wives tale -
 You’re lying. You know one exists and you told him about it. You told
                him about the Elder Wand and where to go looking for it. 
 He tortured me! Besides, I conveyed only rumors. There’s no
                guarantee he will find it -
 He has found it, sir. 
 That’s all, sir. We’ll leave you to get some rest now. 
 He’s after you, Mr. Potter. If it’s true, what you say, that he
                has the Elder Wand, I’m afraid you really don’t stand a chance. 
 Then I guess I’ll just have to kill him before he finds me, sir. 
 You’re sure it’s hers? 
 Positive. 
 I reckon you should take this then. 
 Can’t I use the other? 
 You heard Ollivander. It’s Harry’s now. 
 But I hate that thing -- that’s the wand that killed Sirius! How
                can I hold it and not feel... 
 If I can hold it, you can. 
 How will we know what it is when we get in there? After all, a Horcrux
                can be anything. 
 I’ll know. I can’t explain. It’s like... 
 ... they sing to me.
 That’s a bit scary. 
 It is, Harry. Did Dumbledore ever say anything to you, something
                that might explain why -
 No. I just know. When one’s near. 
 This is the closest I could find to what you described, Hermione. 
 It’s perfect. Thank you, Fleur. 
 You’re leaving, aren’t you. 
 In the morning. 
 And Griphook? 
 He’ll be leaving too. 
 Listen, I don’t know what you’re up to, but I know goblins. If you’ve
                struck any kind of bargain with Griphook, you must be exceptionally careful to live
                up to it. If you don’t... he won’t be forgiving. 
 The sky has lost a star. Luna’s image skitters
                across the mirror’s surface and Harry looks up, finds her standing there clutching
                as mall TRAVELING BAG, staring at Dobby’s stone. 
 My father used to say that when a child died. 
 Funny how Mr. Dobby knew exactly where to find us. 
 Yeah. Funny. Listen, Luna, about your father, I don’t want you to
                think I -
 I know you understand why my father did what he did, Harry. That’s why
                we don’t need to talk about it. 
 Hogwarts? 
 It’s not the place you left, you know. It’s not the same. 
 Neither am I. 
 Always good value. I’ll miss her.
 What d’you think? 
 Wouldn’t know you if I didn’t know you. 
 You want to tell me what that is? 
 Sirius gave it to me. He had a matching piece. He said if I ever
                needed him, all I had to do was look into it. 
 You mean he could see you? 
 Something like that. I don’t know. He died before I ever got to use
                it. The thing is... 
 Go on. 
 You’ll think I’m mental, but more than once, when I’ve looked into it
                -- I think I’ve seen Dumbledore. 
 Bloody hell... that’s a sight. 
 Well, how do I look? 
 Hideous. 
 Oh dear, I missed a spot, didn’tI? Hold still... 
 Couldn’t do anything about that bit in the back that’s always flipping
                up, could you? Dead annoying -
 Never mind. I’m good. (peering warily at her) That is you in there,
                isn’t it? 
 You can give that to Hermione to 
 Madam Lestrange. 
 Good morning. The Warlock eyes her
                oddly, then continues on. As Hermione retreats back into the alley, Griphook emerges
                from the shadows, his voice harsh and mocking. 
 Good morning? Good morning? You’re Bellatrix Lestrange, not some
                dewy-eyed schoolgirl! 
 Hey. Easy. 
 She gives us away and we might as well use that sword to slit our
                own throats. Understand? 
 He’s right. I was being stupid. 
 C’mon. Let’s do it. 
 Identification. 
 I hardly think that will be 
 Madam Lestrange! Dear me! How may I help
                you today? 
 I wish to enter my vault. 
 I see. Very well. Excuse me, won’t you?
 I don’t like to be kept waiting.
 Next. 
 He’s with me. 
 As
                difficult as that may be to imagine.
 They know! Ron stiffens, turns slightly toward
                the empty spot to his left. WHISPERS: 
 What do you mean? 
 They know she’s an imposter! They’ve been
                warned! Ron looks back, watches the two goblins return to Hermione. 
 Madam Lestrange. Would you mind presenting your wand? 
 And why should I do that? 
 Harry, what do we do? Harry...?
 It’s the bank’s policy. I’m sure you understand, given the current
                climate --
 No, I most certainly do not understand --
 I’m afraid I must insist. 
 The door glides shut. The wind dies. Bogrod
                blinks. 
 Very well, Madam Lestrange. you will follow me. If 
 But... Bogrod, there have been special instructions regarding
                theLestrange vault. 
 I’m fully aware of that. I’m also aware the Lestranges are one of our
                oldest and most respected families. 
 Yes, sir, but our instructions are very specific -BOGROD Let me
                be specific with you, Ricbert. I’ve run this bank for forty-five years, long before
                anyone had even heard of a Death Eater. The day may come that they feel they can run
                this place better than me, but that day has not yet arrived. Am I understood! The
                Aged Goblin hesitates, then nods. Hermione. Bogrod turns to 
 Madam, if you will, I will escort you myself. 
 Teffington, see to that door, will you. The guard glances at Ron,
                then reluctantly heads for the entrance. Ron quickly falls in line behind Hermione
                as Bogrod leads them out of the Hall. 
 How long before they come after us? 
 Time will tell. 
 What’s that? Up ahead. 
 I should have known -
 What is that, Griphook? 
 Griphook! What is that! 
 Well done. Hey. 
 You look like... you.
                Hermione is soaking wet and looks like... Hermione. Ron looks like Ron. Griphook
                nods to the waterfall. 
 The Thief’s Downfall. Washes away all enchantments. Can be deadly. 
 You don’t say. (as the cart’s alarms 
 No. 
 What the devil are you all doing down here! 
 We need him! 
 Is this your doing, Griphook? You have no rights here anymore. When
                you gave up your keys, you -
 Imperio! 
 Well done. 
 No. It’s not possible... 
 Bloody hell. That’s a Welsh 
 It looks like it’s been down here forever.
 Go on. 
 It’s been trained to expect pain when it hears the noise.
 That’s barbaric. I...
 We’ll only have a few seconds. In other words... they’ll be no
                do-overs. Understood?
 Ready, Bogrod? 
 Hm? Oh. Yes. Of course.
 Blimey... 
 Look.
 No wonder Bellatrix thought it was real.
 Is it here, Harry? Can you feel anything?
 It’s hot!
 They’ve added Gemino and Flagrante Curses! Everything you touch
                will burn and multiply!
 Ron, your foot!
 We’ll be crushed! Hurry! 
 That’s it. Up there. 
 How’re we going to reach it? 
 Give me the sword! The real one.
 Keep going!
 Harry! Behind you!
 The cup!
 In here!
 We have a deal, Griphook.
 I said I’d get you in. I never said anything about getting you
                out.
 Griphook! Griphook! 
 Thieves! Help! Thieves! 
 Foul little git. Least we’ve got Bogrod. 
 That’s unfortunate. 
 We can’t just stand here! Who’s got an idea? 
 You’re asking us? You’re the brilliant one. 
 I’ve got something. But it’s mad. 
 Relashio! 
 That’s your idea? 
 Come on! 
 It doesn’t realize it’s free! (trying out spells) Leviosa! Aviates!
                Ex Cappa! 
 That was brilliant! BRILLIANT! 
 Bloody hell.
 We’re dropping! The dragon circles, lower and lower. A lake shimmers. 
 I say we jump! 
 When? 
 NOW! 
 The boy has discovered our secret, Nagini. We must find out just
                how much he knows. We must return to our hiding places and see if the others are
                safe.
 And you, my friend, must stay
                close...
 He knows. 
 You-Know-Who. He knows we broke into
                Gringotts. He knows what we took. He knows we’re hunting Horcruxes. 
 How is it you -
 I saw him. 
 You let him in! Harry, you can’t -
 I can’t always help it, Hermione! 
 Maybe I can.
                I don’t know. 
 He’s going to make sure the other 
 He’s angry. But he’s scared too. 
 What happens when he finds out four are gone? 
 I reckon he’ll do anything to stop us from finding the rest. There’s
                more: one of them’s at Hogwarts.
What? 
 You saw it? 
 I saw the castle. And Rowena Ravenclaw. I think it must have something
                to do with her. We have to go there, now. 
 Tonight? But we have to plan. We have to figure out what -
 Honestly, Hermione, when have any of our plans actually worked? We
                plan, we get there and all hell breaks loose. 
 ‘Fraid he’s right. One problem: Snape’s Headmaster now. We can’t just
                walk in the front door. 
 We’ll go to Hogsmeade. To Honeydukes. Take the secret passage in the
                cellar. 
 There’s something wrong with him. In the past, I could always follow
                his thoughts. Now everything feels disconnected. 
 Maybe it’s because of the Horcruxes. Maybe he’s growing weaker. Maybe
                he’s dying. 
 No. It’s more like he’s wounded. If anything, he feels more dangerous.
            
 They were ready for us.

                
 We know you’re here, Potter. There’s no getting away.

                
 Perhaps you need some convincing. 
 What’s he mean by that?
 No, you’ll give us away.
 Expecto Patronum! 

            
 It’s him! He’s down there!
 In here, Potter.
 Did you get a look at him! For a second I thought it was -
 I know. Hearing this, Harry
                slips the mirror from his pocket. FOOTSTEPS sound from below. 
 Harry! I can see you! In here! 
 You bloody fools! What were you thinking coming here? Do you have
                any idea how dangerous it is --
 You’re Aberforth. 
 Dumbledore’s brother. It’s you I’ve been seeing -- here. It’s you who
                sent Dobby. 
 Where’ve you left him? 
 He’s dead. 
 Sorry to hear it. I liked that elf. 
 How’d you come by it? 
 Mundungus Fletcher, ‘bout a year ago. 
 Dung had no right selling you that. It belonged to -ABERFORTH Sirius.
                Albus told me. He also told me that you’d likely be hacked off if you ever found out
                I had it. But ask yourself whereyou’d be if I didn’t. Harry doesn’t respond. 
 Right then. Reckon you’re hungry. Let’s get you fed, then think of
                the best way to get you out ofhere. 
 Do you hear much from the others? From the Order? 
 The Order is finished. You-KnowWho’s won. Anyone who says
                otherwise is kidding themselves. The trio exchange glances. HARRY doesn’t touch the
                food, just stares quietly at ABERFORTH. 
 We need to get into Hogwarts. Dumbledore gave us a job to do. Did he
                now? 
 Nice job? Easy? An awkward silence, the tension heavy. 
 We’ve been hunting Horcruxes. We think the last one’s in the school.
                But we’ll need your help getting in. 
 
 If we can find it and kill it, then we kill him,
                and then we can end this war once and for all. We need to get into Hogwarts tonight.
                Aberforth stares at him for a moment, until the silence grows. 
 It’s not a job my brother’s given you, it’s a suicide mission. Do
                yourself a favor boy. Go home. Live a little longer. 
 Dumbledore trusted me, to see this through. 
 What makes you think you can trust him! What makes you think you
                can believe anything my brother told you! In all the time you knew him, did he ever
                mention my name? Did he ever mention hers? 
 Why should he... 
 You tell me. 
 I only care about the Dumbledore I knew. I trusted him. 
 And why is that? 
 I had no reason not to - 
 That’s a boy’s answer. A boy who goes chasing Horcruxes on the
                word of a man who won’t even tell him where to start. You’re lying. Not just to me,
                which doesn’t matter, but to yourself as well. That’s what a fool does. You’re
                drunk. 
 
 You don’t strike me as a fool, Mr. Potter. So I’ll ask you again.
                There must be a reason. Why do you trust anything my brother ever said to you? Why? 
 Because I need to. Because if I don’t, I don’t know who I am anymore.
                I’ve lost too many people to lie down now. I’m not interested in what happened
                between you and your brother, I don’t even care that you’ve given up. I trust the
                man I knew. I’m going to see this through. 
 I need to get into
                the castle tonight. Silence. HERMIONE and RON exchange a glance. ABERFORTH regards
                HARRY darkly, but HARRY merely stands, waiting. After several seconds, Aberforth’s
                gaze shifts... to the painting. 
 You know what to do... 
 Where’ve you sent her? 
 You’ll see soon enough. 
 That’s Ariana, isn’t it? Your sister. She’s beautiful. 
 She’ll always be beautiful.
 * She died very young, didn’t she.
 My brother sacrificed many things, Mr. Potter, in his journey to
                find power, including her. She was devoted to him --he gave her everything, but
                time. 
 Mr. Dumbledore... thank you. 
 Did save our lives twice. Kept an eye on us in that mirror. That
                doesn’t seem like someone who’s given up, does it? 
 She’s coming back! And she’s got someone with her! 
 Who’s that with her? Bloody hell... 
 I knew you’d come! I told them all! Harry Potter would never abandon
                Hogwarts! 
 Neville... The GILDED FRAME SWINGS OPEN,
                revealing -- in actuality -- what the painting had replicated. Harry pelts
                forward... 
 Neville, you look... 
 Like hell? I reckon. This is nothing. Seamus is worse. You’ll see.
                Hermione! Ron!
 Hey, Ab. There might be a couple more people on the way.
 Well? Ready? 
 I don’t remember this being on the Marauder’s Map. 
 That’s because it never existed till now. The seven secret passages
                were sealed off before the start of the year. This is the only way in or out now.
                The grounds are crawling with Death Eaters and Dementors. 
 How bad is it, Neville? With Snape as Headmaster. 
 Hardly ever see him. It’s the Carrows you have to watch out for. 
 The Carrows? 
 Brother and sister. They’re in charge of discipline. Like
                punishment, the Carrows. 
 They did that to you? But why? 
 Today’s Dark Arts lesson had us practicing the Cruciatus Curse. On
                First Years. I refused. Hogwarts has changed. 
 Aw, c’mon. Don’t be grim. We’re all used to it by now. And the thing
                is, it helps when people stand up, gives everyone hope. I used to notice that when
                you did it, Harry. C’mon, we’re almost there. 
 Let’s have a bit of fun, shall we? 
 Hey! Listen up, you lot! I’ve brought you a surprise! 
 Not more of Aberforth’s cooking, I hope. Be a
                surprise if we could digest it.
 Blimey.
 Get the word out to Remus and the others that Harry’s back.
 River, DA calling. Do you read? We have a new weather report:
                Lightning has struck. I repeat, lightning has struck... 
 Okay, okay! Stand down! Let’s not kill them before You-Know-Who gets
                the chance! 
 Right then. What’s the plan, Harry? Harry
                gazes out over the expectant faces in the room, noting the hollow eyes and broken
                bodies and the desperate, almost palpable desire for hope. For a moment he seems
                lost, awed by the sacrifice his friends have made, much of it for him. Finally, he
                speaks: 
 Okay. There’s something we need to find, something hidden here in the
                castle. It could help us defeat You-Know-Who. 
 What is it? 
 We don’t know. 
 Where is it? 
 Don’t know that either. 
 I realize it’s not much to go on. 
 That’s nothing to go on.
 I think it might have something to do with Ravenclaw. It would be
                small, easy to conceal, valuable. Any ideas? 
 Well, there’s Rowena Ravenclaw’s lost diadem. 
 Oh, bloody hell. Here we go. 
 The lost diadem of Ravenclaw? Hasn’t anyone ever heard of it? It’s
                quite famous. 
 Yes, but Luna, it’s lost. For centuries now. There’s not a person alive
                today who’s seen it. 
 Excuse me. But would someone tell me: what’s a bloody diadem? 
 It’s a kind of crown. You know, like a tiara. 
 Ravenclaw’s was rumored to have magical properties, to enhance the
                wisdom of the wearer.
 Harry. 
 Hey there. 
 Six months she hasn’t seen me and it’s like I’m Frankie First Year. I
                mean, I’m only her brother. 
 Got loads of those, though, doesn’t she? There’s only one Harry. 
 Shut up, Seamus. 
 What is it, Ginny? 
 Snape knows. He knows that Harry was spotted in Hogsmeade. 
 Put a smile on, Miss Reynolds. Wouldn’t want me to have to pay
                a visit to Daddy again, would you? 
 Many of you are surely wondering why I have summoned you here at this
                hour. It has come to my attention that earlier this evening... Harry Potter was
                sighted in Hogsmeade.
 I mention this in the hopes that truth will not be supplanted by
                rumor. For myself and a few select members of the staff this comes as little
                surprise. We have, for some time, considered Mr. Potter’s return to Hogwarts to be
                not only possible but inevitable. Consequently, in the past several months and under
                my specific direction, exhaustive defensive strategies have been employed to defeat
                any attempt Mr. Potter might make to breach these walls. But know this. Should
                anyone -- student or staff -- attempt to aid Mr. Potter, that person will be
                punished in a manner consistent with the severity of their transgression. Rest
                assured: So long as I am Headmaster at Hogwarts, Harry Potter will never again step
                foot in this castle.
 Now then. If anyone here has knowledge of Mr. Potter’s movements this
                evening... I invite them to step forward now.
 I think I can help you out with that...
 It would seem that, despite your exhaustive defensive strategies, you
                have a bit of a security problem, Headmaster.
 And I’m afraid it’s rather extensive. 
 How dare you stand where he stood. 
 Tell them how it was that night. Tell then how you looked him in the
                eye, a man who trusted you... and killed him. Tell them!
 Coward! COWARD! And he didn’t even stay to fight! 
 Mr. Potter, do you mind telling me what you’re doing here,
                which, I trust you realize, is an act of complete and utter lunacy? 
 I’m a Gryffindor. 
 I thought it might have something to do with that. 
 All right! Settle down! Settle down! The room quiets. 
 It appears that your Headmaster, to use the common phrase, has
                done a bunk. 
 Potter...
 I know that many of you will want to fight.
                Some of you may even think this wise. But this is folly.
 I wish you no harm. I have greatrespect for
                the students of Hogwarts. I was once one myselfafter all. I ask for but one thing
                and if granted no magical blood shall be spilt... For a moment they stand, hung in
                silence... 
 Give me Harry Potter. Do this and none shall
                be harmed. Give me Harry Potter and I shall leave Hogwarts untouched. Give me Harry
                Potter and you will be rewarded.
 But he’s there! Potter’s there! Someone grab him!
 Students out of bed! Students in the corridors!
 They’re supposed to be out of bed, you blithering idiot! 
 Oh. Sorry, mum. 
Wait! As it turns out, Mr. Filch, your arrival is most opportune.
                If you would, I’d like you to lead Miss Parkinson and the rest of Slytherin House
                from the Hall. 
 Right away. 
 Er, exactly where is it I’d be
                leadin’ em to, mum? 

                
 The dungeons should do. CHEERS rise again and
                McGonagall’s eyes turn on Harry. She rises up to full height, her jaw firm. 
I presume you have a reason for returning, Potter. What is it you
                need? 
 Time. As much as you can give me. 
 Do what you have to do. I’ll secure the castle. 
 Is that possible, Professor? 
 We teachers are rather good at magic, Potter. We’ve even been
                known to turn out a worthwhile witch or wizard on occasion. 

                
 I think it’s time I ask a few of them to take their magic
                beyond the classroom. What d’you think? Harry follows McGonagall’s gaze, sees
                Neville and Ginny conferring with a sprinkling of DA members. 
 I think you’re right. 
 By the way, Potter... 
 It’s good
                to see you. 
 You, too, Professor.
 Let me get this straight, Professor. You’re giving us permission to
                do this? 
 That is correct, Longbottom. 
 To blow it up. Boom. 
 Boom. 
 Wicked. 
 Um... exactly how do you propose we
                do this, Professor? 
 Why don’t you confer with Mr. Finnegan. As I recall, he has a
                particular proclivity for pyrotechnics.
 I can bring ‘er down. 
That’s the spirit. Now off you go.
 You realize, of course, that nothing we do will be able to keep out
                You-Know-Who indefinitely. 
 That doesn’t mean we can’t hold him up. 
 That doesn’t mean we can’t hold him up. And his name is
                Voldemort, Filius. You might as well use it. He’s going to try to kill you either
                way.
Piertotum Locomotor! 
 Hogwarts is threatened! Man the boundaries and protect us! Do
                your duty to our school!
 I’ve always wanted to use that spell. Several yards off, Flitwick
                holds his wand aloft, his face grimly determined. Momentarily a “disturbance”
                troubles the atmosphere -- this is powerful stuff -- McGonagall and other Staff
                members step forward to assist, wands raised high. Together, they conjure... 
 Protego Maxima... Finato Duri... Repello Inimicum... 
 Harry, Hermione and I have been thinking. It doesn’t really matter if we
                find the Horcrux.
 What’re you saying? 
 Unless we can destroy it. 
 So we were thinking -
 You were thinking. It’s Ron’s idea. And it’s brilliant. 
 You destroyed Tom Riddle’s Diary with a Basilisk fang, right? Well, we
                know where we might find one, don’t we? 
 Okay. But take this. That way you can find me when you get back. 
 Where are you going? 
 Ravenclaw Common Room. Got to start somewhere.
 Harry! Wait! I need to talk to you! 
 I’m a bit preoccupied right now, Luna. 
 But you won’t find anything where you’re going. You’re wasting your
                time. 
 We’ll talk later, Luna. 
 Harry -
 Later.
 HARRY POTTER! YOU LISTEN TO ME RIGHT NOW!
 Don’t you remember what Cho said about Rowena Ravenclaw’s diadem:
                ‘There’s not a person alive who’s seen it.’
 It’s obvious, isn’t it? We have to talk to someone who’s dead. 
 He’s very impressive, isn’t he? 
 They never learn. Such a pity. Voldemort smiles, as if amused. His
                eyes gleam fiercely. Begin. 
 Bellatrix RAISES HER ARM in signal and the sea of Death Eaters
                settle, poised and waiting. The air goes still... 
 But, my Lord, shouldn’t we wait -Voldemort’s eyes shift, killing
                the remainder of Thicknesse’s sentence before it can escape his throat. Bellatrix’s
                eyes narrow in contempt. Chilled, Thicknesse looks away. Then -- as if burying a
                knife deep in the heart of an enemy... Bellatrix drops her arm. 
 Nice night for it! Harry turns to Luna. Okay, Luna. mind? 
 Who’ve you got in 
 That’s it. I want a charge on each and every
                joist.
 You do know what you’re doing, don’t you, Seamus?
 Blimey.
 Not good. 
 If you’re to find her, you’ll find her down there. 
 Aren’t you coming? 
 No. I think it best if you two talk alone. She’s very shy. Luna exits.
                Harry eyes the shadows ahead. 
 Tell Professor McGonagall Remus and I will handle this
                side of the castle. Yes, sir. 
 As Dean starts off, the grounds beyond and below come INTO VIEW: a sea
                of Death Eaters. Kingsley and Remus stop dead, narrow their eyes. 
 Dean! (as Dean stops) On second thought, tell Professor
                McGonagall we might need one or two more wands this side. Dean nods, continues on,
                merely trading a glance withArthur, Fred and George as they appear, staring in
                stunned disbelief at the deadly throng across the landscape. 
 It’s the quality of one’s conviction that determines success, not the
                number of one’s followers. Lupin stares straight ahead, as does Shacklebolt. 
 Who said that? Me. 
 For the first time, they look at each other, share a fatalistic smile.
                Just then TONKS appears. 
 Speaking of quality. 
 You shouldn’t have. It’s Teddy who needs you. 
 He’ll sleep ‘til dawn and snore like his father. It’s you who needs me
                tonight.
 It’s you... 
 Ha! Ha! 
 Yeah! You and whose army! 
 Woah! Easy up there! 
 Sorry. 
 Ow. 
Take me inside.
 Harry talks in his sleep. Haven’t you noticed? 
 No. Of course not. 
 I’ve never got this far before. I’m scared. 
 Ron looks at her, then hoists himself through. Me too. 
 
 I didn’t expect it to be like this. 
 What did you expect it to be like? Not this. 
 
 You’re the Grey Lady, the ghost ofRavenclaw Tower. 
 I do not answer to that name. 
 I’m sorry. It’s Helena, isn’t it? Helena Ravenclaw. Rowena’s daughter.
                Luna told me. 
 Are you a friend of Luna’s? 
 Yes. She thought you might be able to help me. 
 You seek my mother’s diadem. 
 Yes! That’s right -
 Luna is kind. Unlike so many of the others, but she was wrong. I
                cannot help you. 
 Wait! Please! 
 Many have sought my mother’s diadem. Its powers are legendary... 
 But I don’t care about its powers! Honestly -
 I don’t seek it for myself! You have to believe me! 
 I want to destroy it. 
 That’s what you want, isn’t it, Helena? You want it destroyed. 

                
 She thought I took it to hurt her. 
             But I only wanted to be more like her,
                clever and wise. She wore it so beautifully, but on me... I grew to hate it... the
                pain I felt... the pain I feel even now... 
 I’ll end your pain, Helena. Tell me where it is and I’ll destroy it, I
                swear, on my mother’s memory -
 Another swore to destroy it, many years ago, a strange boy with
                a strange name... 
 Tom Riddle -
 But he lied. 
 He’s lied to many people -
 I know what he’s done! I know who he is! He defiled it! With
                Dark Magic! 
 Yes. That’s right. But I can undo that, Helena. I can destroy it once
                and for all. But only if you tell me where he hid it. You know where he hid it,
                don’t you, Helena? You just have to tell me. Please. 
 Trust me.
 Strange... you remind me of him a bit... 
 It’s here. In the castle. In the place where everything is
                hidden...
If you have to ask, you’ll never know. If you know, you need only
                ask... 
 Thank you...
 Thank you...
 You do it. 
 Yes, you can. 
 Fall inside! Everybody! Fall inside!
 Not good. 
 Ready!? 
 Are you bloody joking?! 
 Oh God -
 He’s good...
 He’s good... 
 Well done, Seamus! 
 Told yeh I’d bring ‘er down. As Neville
                glowers at him, Ginny reaches out, hoists him onto what’s left of the bridge.
                Neville shakes some ASHES from his head and then... GRINS unexpectedly. 
 What? 
 That was kind of exciting. 
 Mad. The both of you. 
 Not good.
 Night-tee night. 
 You let us out of here, you filthy squib!
 Ginny! Neville! You alright? 
 Never better! Feel like I could spit fire! Haven’t seen Luna, have
                you? 
 Luna -- ? 
 I’m mad for her! Think it’s about time I told her, seeing as there’s
                a pretty good chance we’ll both be dead by dawn! 
 I know. 
 Bloody hell. We’ll never find him 
 There he is. 
 What? 
 Brilliant. 
 He vanished. Just now. I saw it. 
 He must’ve gone into the Room of Requirement. It doesn’t show on the
                map, remember? You said so last year. 
 That’s right. I did. 
 Let’s go. 
 Brilliant. 
 Take my hand. 
 Now. 
 Well, well, what brings you here, Potter? 
 I could ask you the same. 
 I virtually lived here last year. Remember? 
 I remember. 
 You have something of mine. I’d like it back. 
 What’s wrong with the one you have? 
 It’s my mother’s. It’s very powerful, but
                it’s not the same. It doesn’t... understand me. 
 Know what
                I mean? Just then, over Draco’s shoulder and several yards beyond, a SHADOW FLICKERS
                (Ron). Harry looks down, notices a DROP of WATER fall from the PANT CUFF, cuts his
                eyes away. He reaches for the wand in his pocket. 
 Easy. 
 Why didn’t you tell her? 
 Bellatrix. You knew it was me. But you didn’t say anything. 
 Give me my wand. 
 No. I don’t think so... 
 Besides, its allegiance is to me now. If you want it, you’ll have to
                win it back. Perhaps even kill me... 
 C’mon, Draco. Don’t be a prat. Just do ’im.
 Avada Kedavra!
 Expelliarmus! 
 Did you see where it went? The diadem! 
 It’s gone! We’ll never -
 Well done. Let’s find Ron and get out of here.
 RUN! Goyle’s set the bloody place on fire! 
 Split up! 
 Do we climb! 
 No, it’ll just follow us! 
 Here! Take one!
 Serves him right. 
 C’mon! This way!
 Wait! What about Malfoy and Blaise! 
 He’s joking, right? Then Harry sees them,
                perched atop a fragile, crumbling tower. Harry whips his broom around and jets
                forth. Ron shakes his head, then jets after, BELLOWING: 
 IF WE DIE FOR THEM, I’LL KILL YOU, HARRY!
 Brilliant. 
 Nagini. Come. 
 You’re bloody well welcome! 
 Prat. Ron looks
                back, to Hermione, and follows her gaze to Harry, who stares into the distance, his
                face still bearing traces of the agony he’s just endured. 
 Ron, you once asked me if I thought he felt it -- Voldemort -- when we
                destroy a Horcrux, when we destroy a piece of his soul. 
 He does. 
 It’s the snake. She’s the last one. The last Horcrux. 
 Where will he take her? 
 Someplace safe. 
 No. He’ll keep her close. 
 Look inside him, Harry. 
 Find out where he is. If we find him, we find the snake. Then we’re one
                step closer to ending this.
 Stop looking at her. She smells your fear. It agitates her. Be
                grateful she’s just eaten. 
 Forgive me, my Lord, but wouldn’t it be more prudent to call
                off this battle and seek the boy yourself? 
 I do not need to seek the boy! Before the night is out, he will
                come to me! Do you understand! 
 Of c-course, my Lord. 
 How do you live with yourself, Lucius? 
 Go. Find Severus. Tell him I need to see him immediately.
 I know where he is. 
 There’s more to me than incense and tea leaves, Mr. Finnegan. 
 Thanks. 
 Don’t mention it. 
 NO!
 Why doesn’t it work for me? 
 You have performed extraordinary magic with this wand, my Lord. In the
                last few hours alone -
 No! I am extraordinary! But the wand resists me! 
 There is no wand more powerful. Ollivander himself said it. Tonight,
                when the boy comes to you, it will not fail you, I am sure. It answers to you and
                you only. 
 Does it? 
 My Lord? 
 The wand. Does it truly answer tome? 
 You’re a clever man, Severus. Surely you must know. 
 Where, Severus? Where does its loyalty lie? 
 With you, of course, my Lord. 
 The Elder Wand cannot serve me properly, Severus, because I am not
                its true master. VOLDEMORT 
 The Elder Wand belongs to thewizard who
                killed its last owner. Ollivander was quite explicit about that. You killed
                Dumbledore, Severus. While youlive, the Elder Wand cannot be truly mine. Snape
                stares at Voldemort, then his eyes shift to Nagini, still circling. 
 My Lord -
 You have been a good and faithful servant, Severus.
 But only I can live forever...
 Kill.
 Nagini! Come!
 Take them... 
 Take them!
 Please.
 Give me something! Quickly! A flask! Anything. 
 They are the same... 
 You have your mother’s eyes... 
 He’s gone. The snake too. 
 You have fought valiantly... but in vain. I do
                not wish this. Every drop of magical blood spilled is a terrible waste. I therefore command my forces to
                retreat. In their absence, dispose of your dead with dignity. Treat your injured.
                    
 Harry Potter, I speak now directly to you. On this night
                you have allowed your friends to die for you rather than face me yourself. There is
                no greater dishonor. Join me in the Forbidden Forest and confront your fate. Should
                you do so I give my word that no other life will be lost on this night. You have one
                hour. If, at the end of that time, you have not given yourself up, then I shall
                punish every last man, woman and child who tries to conceal you from me. The joist
                trembles one last time, then the ambient sounds of the night return. The clouds
                separate, become just clouds. Ron YELLS: 
 Never! Do you hear me! NEVER! 
 Where is everyone? 
 Lily! 
 Come out of there! Now! FADE IN: 
 We’re going home.
 She’s jealous. Because she’s ordinary and you’re special. 
 That’s mean. 
 It’s true. You know so yourself.
 No! Don’t kill me! 
 That wasn’t my intention. 
 Stand up, Severus. I haven’t much time. What message do you bring
                from Lord Voldemort this time? 
 None. I come on my own account. I come with a...
                request. Dumbledore’s eyes flicker briefly with interest. He studies Snape’s fearful
                face. 
 Is this about the Prophecy? 
 Yes. 
 How much did you relay? 
 Only what I heard. But now... he thinks it refers to her. 
 The Prophecy did not refer to a woman. It spoke of a boy born at
                the end of July -
 Yes! But he thinks it’s her son! He intends to hunt them down now! To
                kill them! 
 If she means so much to you, surely Lord Voldemort would spare
                her in exchange for the boy. I have asked. 
 
 You disgust me. You would sacrifice the life of an innocent child
                over a schoolboy crush? 
 She’s more than that! She’s different! Beautiful. Kind. 
 Hide them all. I beg you. 
 And should I do so, what will you give me in return, Severus?
                Anything. 
 You said you would keep her safe! 
 Lily and James put their faith in the wrong person. Rather like
                you, Severus. Snape reels, staring miserably at the SLATE SKY beyond the windows.
                Dumbledore studies him cunningly. 
 The boy survives. Snape’s eyes shift. Regard Dumbledore. 
 He has her eyes. DON’T! 
 
 If you loved Lily Evans, Severus. If you truly loved her. Then
                your way is clear. 
 He doesn’t need protection. The Dark Lord has gone -
 The Dark Lord will return. And the boy will be in terrible danger
                when he does. 
 No one can know. Your word. 
 My word that I shall never reveal the best of you, Severus? If
                you insist. 
 He exhibits no measurable talent. His arrogance rivals even his
                father’s. And he seems to relish his fame. 
 Sometimes we see what we expect to see, Severus. Other teachers
                indicate the boy is modest, likeable and while no prodigy, possesses above-average
                gifts. Personally, I find him rather engaging. 
 You see what you want to see. 
 Perhaps. Oh. Severus. 
 Keep an eye on
                Professor Quirrell, won’t you?
 Why did you put it on? Surely you realized it carried a curse. 
 I was... foolish... greedy... 
 Drink the rest. It will contain the curse to the hand for the time
                being. 
 For the time being? 
 It will spread. 
 How long? 
 Maybe a year. 
 Well, this makes matters much more straightforward. 
 Do not ignore me, Severus. Was it not you who told me of Lord
                Voldemort’s plan to have the Malfoy boy murder me? 
 It is not expected that he will succeed. 
 But should he fail, one would presume the Dark Lord will turn
                to... you. 
 You must agree. 
 Yes. You must be the one to kill me, Severus. It is the only way.
                Only then will the Dark Lord trust you completely. 
 You ask too much. 
 Too much! Nothing I could ask is too
                much. You know what is at stake! You more than anyone! Snape says nothing.
                Dumbledore sits back, painfully studies his hand. 
 There will come a time when HarryPotter must be told something.
                But you must wait until Voldemort is at his most vulnerable. 
 Tell him what? 
 On the night Lord Voldemort went to Godric’s Hollow to kill
                Harry, and Lily Potter cast herself between them, the curse rebounded. When that
                happened, a part of Lord Voldemort’s soul latched itself onto the only living thing
                it could find: Harry himself. 
 There’s a reason Harry can speak with snakes. There’s a reason he
                can look into Lord Voldemort’s mind. A part of Lord Voldemort lives inside him. 
 So when the time comes, the boy must die. 
 Yes. And Voldemort himself must do it. That is essential.
 You’ve kept him alive so that he can die at the proper moment. You’ve
                been raising him like a pig for slaughter. 
 But this is touching, Severus. Don’t tell me you’ve grown to care
                for the boy?
 Expecto Patronum!
 Lily. After all this time? 
 Always... 
 The irony of course, Severus, is that -- in
                the end -- you and the boy desire the same thing...
 Where’ve you been? 
 We thought you’d gone to the forest, we thought you might be -
 I’m going there now. 
 Are you mad! No! 
 It’s... meant to be. 
 Rubbish! You can’t just give yourself up to him -
 What is it, Harry? What is it you know?
 There’s a reason I can... hear them -- the Horcruxes. 
 I think I’ve known for awhile. 
 I think
                you’ve known too. Hermione stands still, miserable. 
 I’ll go with you. I’ll -
 Kill the snake. Kill the snake and then it’s just him. Then it will be
                over. 
 I’ll take him from here. 
 It’s all right. We’re going to get you inside.
 I kept calling. No one came. 
 Don’t worry. I won’t leave you. I promise.
 Once. Twice. Thrice... Harry stands for a
                moment and then, slowly, opens his eyes. Reacts. FOUR PEOPLE stand within the
                Forest: JAMES POTTER, SIRIUS BLACK, REMUS LUPIN and LILY POTTER. Lily eyes him
                lovingly and beckons him forth. As if in a dream, Harry drifts through the trees,
                stops before her. 
 You’ve been so brave, sweetheart. 
 Why are you here? All of you? 
 We never left, dear. 
 Does it hurt? Dying? 
 Quicker than falling asleep. 
 And he will want it to be quick. 
 You’re nearly there, son. 
 I’m sorry. I didn’t want any of you to die for me. And Remus, your
                son... 
 Others will tell him what his mother and father died for. Someday
                he’ll understand... 
 You’ll stay with me? 
 Until the end. 
 He won’t be able to see you? 
 No. We’re here, you see. 
 Stay close to me. 
 Always... 
 No sign of him, my Lord. 
 I thought he would come. I was, it seems... mistaken. 
 You weren’t. 
 HARRY! NO! WHAT’RE YEH DOIN’ ‘ERE! 
 Quiet!
 Harry Potter. The Boy Who Lived. Come to die.
 You cannot help. 
 Harry. You wonderful boy. You brave, brave man. Let us walk. 
 Sir, this, is this... I mean, forgive me, but you are dead, aren’t
                you, sir? 
 Oh, yes. 
 Then... I’m dead too? 
 Ah. That is the question, isn’t it? On the whole I think not. 
 Not? 
 Not. 
 But I didn’t defend myself. I let him kill me. 
 And that will, I think, have made all the difference. I suspect
                you now realize that you and Voldemort have been connected by something other than
                fate since that night in Godric’s Hollow all those years ago, Harry. 
 It’s true, isn’t it, sir? A bit of him lives in me, doesn’t it? 
 Did. It was just destroyed only moments ago by none other than
                Voldemort himself. 
 You were the seventh Horcrux, Harry; the Horcrux he never meant
                to make. 
 And you knew this? That’s why you were certain I wouldn’t die? 
 Certain? No. Little is certain in this world, Harry. Call it an
                educated guess. 
 Professor, is that -- ? 
 Something beyond either of our help. 
 Exactly where are we, sir? 
 I was going to ask you that. Where would you say that we are? 
 It looks like King’s Cross station -- only a lot cleaner. And without
                the trains. 
 King’s Cross! Is that right? Well, this is, as they say, your
                party. 
 Sir, why didn’t you just tell me about the Deathly Hallows? 
 You will have to forgive me, Harry. You see... I didn’t trust
                you.
 I feared that you would make the same mistake I made, that you
                would be intoxicated by the power the Hallows promise their possessor. But I crave
                your pardon, Harry. It’s clear to me now, as it should have been all along, that you
                are the better man. 
 Sir -
 You are the worthy possessor of the Hallows, Harry, not me. I was
                fit to own the Elder Wand, because I took it not for gain, but to save others from
                it. But I took the Stone because I longed to recall someone who has long been at
                peace and for that I paid with my life. 
 You wanted to see Ariana again, didn’t you, sir? 
 Yes. 
 I used the Stone as well, sir, only a little while ago when I entered
                the Forest. I saw my mum and dad, and Sirius and Lupin... 
 True. But ask yourself this: were you calling them? Or were they
                calling you? 

                
 You are the true master of death, Harry,
                because the true master does not seek to run away from death. He accepts that he
                must die, and understands that there are far, far worse things in the living
                world.
 I’ve got to go back, haven’t I? 
 That is up to you. 
 I’ve got a choice? 
 Oh yes. We are in King’s Cross, you say? I think, should you so
                decide, you would be able to, let’s say, board a train. 
 And where would it take me? 
 On. 
 Voldemort’s got the Elder Wand. 
 True. 
 And the snake lives. 
 Yes. 
 And I’ve nothing to kill it with. 
 ‘Help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it.’ 
 I have always prized my ability to turn a phrase -- words are, in
                my not so humble opinion, our most inexhaustible source of magic, capable both of
                inflicting injury and remedying it. But I would --in this case -- amend my original
                statement to this: 
 Help will always be given at
                Hogwarts to those who most deserve it... 
 Assuming
                circumstances in the main are favorable to such an outcome, of course. 
 With all due respect, sir, I think what we need here is a miracle. 
 I’ve never put much stock in miracles, Harry. On the other hand,
                I can attest wholly to the extensive advantages of a related phenomenon. 
 Which would be, sir? 
 Luck.
 Do not pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living and, above all,
                those who live without love. 
 Sir, my mother’s Patronus. It was a doe, wasn’t it? Just like
                Professor Snape’s. Curious, don’t you think? 
 Actually, if I think about it... it doesn’t seem curious at all.
                    
 I’ll be going now, Harry. 
 Professor. 
 Is this real? Or has this been happening inside my head? 
 Of course it is happening inside your head, Harry. But why should
                that mean that it is not real? 

                
 Is he alive...? 
 My lord, let me help you -
 I do not require assistance.
 The boy. Is he dead?
 Is he alive? Draco? 
 Don’t despair, Longbottom. I put you in Gryffindor for good
                reason... 
 Who’s that? Neville turns, sees that Ginny has
                come out onto the broken steps and is staring at the procession. 
 ... Hagrid’s carrying? 
 Neville, who is that? 
 What’s going on here, Neville?
 Behold, Nagini. Our work is done. 
 No... NO! 
 SILENCE! 
 Stupid girl. You cry for that? 
 Tell me. These last few hours -- as
                you collected the dead and tended your wounded -- was he by your side? Voldemort
                surveys the throng, who stand mute. He nods, as if their silence were answer enough. 
 While your hands ran dark with the blood of mothers and sons,
                fathers and daughters, brothers and sisters, his were clasped in prayer -- but it
                was a prayer for one and one only. While you battled courageously, until you could
                no longer will yourself to stand, he had long since fallen to his knees. While you
                cursed me until your voices grew ragged, he begged me for mercy in a voice as meek
                as a child’s.
So do not cry for that. He’s not worthy of your tears. And do not
                despair of his betrayal. You were never in his heart. Not for one single solitary
                beat. 
 Liar!
 Did you not hear me! Harry Potter is dead! From this day forward,
                you put your faith in me or suffer the consequences. HARRY POTTER IS DEAD!
 Now is the time to declare yourself.
 Draco... 
 Draco, don’t be stupid -
 Come, Draco. 
 He saved your life. 
 Well done, Draco. Who will be next? Hm? Come now, don’t be
                shy.
 Well, I must say, I’d hoped for better. Is this truly the best
                Hogwarts has to offer? 
 Who might you be, young man? 
 Neville Longbottom. 
 Well, welcome, Neville. I’m sure we can find a place for you in
                our ranks. 
 Someone has to do the washing. 
 Now, now, Bellatrix. Let’s not underestimate our young friend. By
                stepping forward, he lives to see another day... 
 I’d like to say something.
 Very well, Neville. I’m sure we’d all be fascinated to hear what
                you have to say. 
 It doesn’t matter that Harry is gone.
 Stand down, Neville!
 People die every day. Friends. Family. Yes, we lost Harry tonight.
                But he’s still with us, here - 
 And so is Fred and
                Remus and Tonks and... all of them. They didn’t die in vain. 
 But you will. 
 And you
                and you and you will. 
 And so will you. Because you’re
                wrong. Harry’s heart did beat for us. All of us... 
 This isn’t over.
 Potter!
 Well done, Malfoy! 
 Can’t believe I just said
                that.
 Confringo!
 The snake! We’ve got to kill the snake! 
 Harry! Look out!
 Nagini! With me!
 Leave her!
 I said LEAVE HER!

                
 Now, my sweet. Now.
 Nagini! 
 Die! Die! 
 Why do you live! 
 Because I have something worth living for.
 Confringo!
 NOT MY DAUGHTER, YOU BITCH!
 Come on, granny, give us your best.
 Back off, boys! She’s mine! 
You will never touch my children again! 
 Be thankful we only took one. Besides... 
 It’s not like you don’t have a spare.
 Hermione! 
 Yes! 
 I need to tell you something! 
 I don’t want you to say anything you wouldn’t say if we weren’t
                about to be killed by a giant snake! It’ll just ruin it!
 You were right.
 When you told Professor Snape it was failing you. It will always fail
                you. 
 It belongs to me! I killed Snape! 
 But what if the wand never belonged to him?
                What if the wand’s allegiance was to someone else? Voldemort stares at him.
                Confused. And suddenly, in this moment, it is Harry, beaten and bloody, who seems in
                control. He smiles, then presses even closer, his voice quiet, vaguely taunting: 
 Come on, Tom. Let’s end this the way we started it... 
 Together. 
 What’s the matter with her? 
 There’s more to me than incense and tea leaves, Mr. Finnegan.
            
 I told you: it’s useless to you.
 Not exactly leaving the place better than we found it, are we? 
 Can’t make an omelette without breaking a few eggs. 
 Something my mum used to say. 
 Why didn’t it work for him? The Elder wand. 
 Because it answers to another. 
 When he killed Snape, he thought the wand would become his. But the
                thing is... it never belonged to Snape. 
 It was Draco who disarmed Dumbledore that night on the Astronomy
                Tower. From that moment on, the wand answered to him. Until the other night...
                    
 ... when I disarmed Draco. 
 But that means... 
 It answers to me. 
 What do you reckon we should do with it? 
 We? 
 I’m just saying. That’s the Elder Wand! It’s the most powerful bloody
                wand in the world! With that, we could, we could -
 Well, it wasn’t boring, was it?
 Together?
 Don’t forget to give Professor Longbottom our best.
 Will there really be thestrals pulling the carriages?
 There’s nothing scary about thestrals. They’re gentle things.
                Anyway, you won’t be going up to school in the carriages. You’ll be going in the
                boats, remember?
 Dad? 
 Yes? 
 What if I’m put in Slytherin? 
 Albus Severus Potter. You were named after two Headmasters of
                Hogwarts. One of them was a Slytherin. And he was probably the bravest man I ever
                knew. 
 But just say I am --
 Then Slytherin House will have gained a wonderful wizard. But
                listen, if it means so much to you, you can choose Gryffindor. The Sorting Hat takes
                your choice into account. 
 Really? 
 Really. 
 Ready? 
 Ready.
 These are dark times, there is no denying. Our world has perhaps
                faced no greater threat than it does today. But I say this to our citizenry: we,
                ever your servants, continue to defend your liberty and repel the forces that would
                seek to take it from you. Your Ministry remains strong...

                
 Hermione. Your tea is ready, dear.
 Coming, Mum.
 Don’t you look lovely. All packed? 
 Are you sure these biscuits are sugar-free? 
 Quite sure, dear. See the big bold letters that say ‘SugarFree’?
                Dead giveaway. 
 Mm. Yes. 
 Hello, kitten. Don’t you
                look lovely. 
 Darling, don’t be suspicious the biscuits taste so good, be
                grateful the company’s so clever... Hermione looks away from the screen, studies her
                mother and father. Slowly, she reaches into the tiny bag and withdraws her wand.
                Taking two steps forward, she points it toward the back of their heads. Hand
                trembling, sheSPEAKS, her VOICE barely a WHISPER: 
 Obliviate.
 Goodbye. 
 What are those? 
 Close the door. Ron eases inside and steps to the workbench.
                Mr. Weasley turns the knob on the radio before him. STATIC spits forth, then a VOICE
                comes clear: RADIO 
 ...comes to us this evening from the north of
                England, where a wizard family by the name of Westinburgh were found dead in their
                cellar. While not a member of the Order, Mr. Westinburgh and his wife had, on
                numerous occasions, provided shelter for its members... 
 These are for the Order. So many are on the run now, it helps
                them to stay connected with the rest of us. Know they’re not alone...
 C’mon. Mum’s got dinner ready. 
 Severus. I was beginning to worry you’d lost your way. Come. I’ve
                saved you a seat. 
 You know our hosts, of course, Severus. Narcissa in particular has
                been most hospitable. Lucius, on the other hand, is, I fear, burdened by my
                presence. Are you, Lucius? 
 My lord? 
 Are you burdened? 
 My lord is always welcome here. 
 You bring news I trust, Severus? 
 It will happen Saturday next. At nightfall. 
 And this information comes-- 
 --from the source we discussed. 
 I have heard differently, my lord. Dawlish, the Auror, let slip that
                the Potter boy will not be moved until the thirtieth of this month, the night before
                he turns seventeen. 
 This is a false trail. The Auror Office no longer plays any part in
                the protection of Harry Potter. Those closest to him believe we have infiltrated the
                Ministry. 
 Well, they’ve got that right, then, ‘aven’t they? 
 Pius, what say you? 
 One hears many things, my lord. Whether the truth is among them
                is not clear. 
 Spoken like a true politician. You will, I think, prove most
                useful, Pius. Where will he be taken? The boy? 
 To a safehouse. Likely the home of someone in the Order. I’m told it
                has been given every manner of protection possible. Once there, it will be
                impractical to attack him. We may have compromised the Ministry, but there are those
                who remain loyal to him. As long as the Ministry stands, his allies within will have
                the means at their disposal to insure his safety. 
 My lord, if I might, I’d like to volunteer myself for this task.
                I’d like to kill the boy. 
 Wormtail! Have I not spoken to you about keeping our guest quiet? 
 Yes, m-my lord. Right away, my lord. 
 As inspiring as I find your bloodlust, Bellatrix, I must be the
                one to kill Harry Potter. But I face an unfortunate complication. It has recently
                come to my attention that my wand and Potter’s share the same core. They are, in
                some ways, twins. We can wound but not fatally harm one another. Which means, if I
                am to kill him... I will have to do it with another’s wand. 
 Come now. Surely one of you would like the honor? What
                about...you, Lucius? 
 I require your wand. 
 Do I detect elm? 
 Yes, my lord. 
 And the core? 
 Dragon -- dragon heartstring. 
 My wand? You can’t possibly thinkI would give you my wand. 
 No, my lord. 
 For those of you who do not know, we are joined tonight by Miss
                Charity Burbage who until recently taught at Hogwarts School ofWitchcraft and
                Wizardry. Her specialty was Muggle studies. It is Miss Burbage’s belief that Muggles
                are not so different from us. She would, given her way, have us mate with them. To
                her, the mixture of magical and Muggle blood is not an abomination but something to
                be encouraged. I, of course, take a contrary view. But we’re all civilized here. All
                adults. We can agree to disagree. 
 Severus, please. We’re friends... 
 Avada Kedavra! 
 Nagini... Dinner. 

                
 Come now, Dudley. Hurry up! 
 Time for the teary farewell. 
 I’ve lived in this house twenty years. And now -- in a single
                night -- I’m expected to leave. 
 They’ll torture you. Even Dudley. If they think you know where I’m
                going, they’ll stop at noth- 
 You think I don’t know that? You think I don’t know what they’re
                capable of? 
 You didn’t just lose a mother that night in Godric’s Hollow, you
                know. I lost a sister. 
 Do you have any? Magic? 
 What a cruel thing to ask. 
 Well, this is goodbye then, boy. 
 I don’t understand. Isn’t he coming with us? 
 Who? 
 Harry. 
 Absolutely not. 
 Why? 
 Well, because -- he doesn’t want to, do you, boy? 
 Absolutely not. Besides, I’m just a waste of space. Isn’t that right,
                Vernon? Uncle Vernon stares hard at Harry. 
 Come on, Dudley, we’re off. 
 I don’t think you’re a waste of space. 
 Well... thanks. Harry grips Dudley’s hand, then watches his cousin
                turn and lope back across the lawn. 

                
 See you, Big D. 
 Good riddance. 
 All righ’, ‘arry? Yeh look fit. 
 Yeah, he’s ruddy gorgeous. What say we get undercover before someone
                murders him. 
 I thought you were looking after the Prime Minister, Kingsley. 
 You’re more important. Harry grins, then a tall, red-headed man
                    
 is before him, hand extended. His face is
                horriblySCARRED. 
 Hello, Harry. Bill Weasley. 
 Wasn’t always this handsome. 
 Dead ugly. 

                
 True enough. Owe it all to a werewolf by name of
                Greyback. Hope to repay the favor one day. 

                
 You are still beautiful to me, William. 
 Just remember, Fleur, once you’re married: Bill takes his steaks on
                the raw side now. 
 My husband, the joker. By the way, wait until you hear the news! Remus
                and I are - 
 All right, all right! You’ll all have time for a cozy catch-up later!
                We’ve got to get the hell out of here and soon! 
 Potter, you’re underage, which means you’ve still got the Trace on
                you. 
 The Trace? 
 You sneeze and the Ministry willk now who wipes your nose. Point is,
                we have to use those means of transport the Trace can’t detect: brooms, thestrals
                and the like. We’ll go in pairs. That way if anyone’s out there waiting for us-- and
                I reckon there will be -- they won’t know which Harry Potter is the real one. 
 The real one...? 
 I believe you’re familiar with this particular brew. 
 No! Absolutely not! 

                
 I told you he’d take it well. 
 If you think I’m going to let people risk their lives for me - 
 Never done that before, have we? 
 This is different. Taking that. Becoming me -- no. 
 Well, none of us really fancy it, mate. 
 Yeah, imagine if something went wrong and we were stuck as scrawny,
                specky gits forever. 
 Everyone here’s of age, Potter, and they’ve all agreed to take the
                risk. 
 Technically, I’ve been coerced. 
 Mundungus Fletcher, Mr. Potter. I’ve always been a
                huge admirer. 
 Nip it, Mundungus! All right, Granger, as discussed. 
 Blimey, Hermione! 
 Straight in here, if you please. 
 For those of you who haven’t taken Polyjuice Potion before, fair
                warning. It tastes like goblin piss. 
 Have a lot of experience with that, do you, Mad-Eye? 
 Just trying to defuse the tension. 
 Wow -- we’re identical! 
 Not yet you aren’t. 
 Don’t have something a bit more sporty, do you? 
 Yes, don’t fancy this color at all. 
 Fancy this: You’re not you, so shut it and strip. 
 You’ll need to change too, Potter. 
 Bill, look away -- I’m ‘ideous. 

                
 I knew Ginny was lying about that tattoo. 

                
 Harry, your eyesight really is awful. 
 Blimey. I almost forgot. 
 Right then. We’ll be pairing off. Each Potter will have a protector.
                As for you, Harry... 
 Yes? 
 The real Harry! Where the devil are you, anyway? 
 Here. 
 You’ll ride with Hagrid. 
 Brought yeh here sixteen years ago when you were barely bigger than a
                Bowtruckle. Seems only righ’ I should be the one ter take yeh away. 
 Yeah, it’s all very touching. Let’s go. 
 Good luck, everyone. On the count of three. One... two --
 Hagrid! We’ve got to help the others! 
 Can’t do it, ‘arry. My job’s ter get you where we’re goin’ safe ‘n
                sound -- Mad-Eye’s orders! 
 What was that? 
 Dragon fire! 
 That’s him! The real one! 
 Hol’ tight, ‘arry! We’ve got ter get yeh out of here! 
 Hagrid... HAGRID...! 
 Avada... 
 Harry! Hagrid! What happened?! Have you seen the others? 
 Is no one back yet? 
 They were on us from the star’, Molly -- the Death Eaters. And
                You-Know-Who as well. 
 Well, thank goodness you two are all right. 
 Haven’t go’ any brandy, have yeh, Molly? Fer medicinal purposes?
                    
 Ron and Tonks should’ve already been back. Dad and Fred as well.
                    
 Oh my God! George! 
 The house! Quickly! 
 My boy! My darling boy! What’ve they done to you?! 
 Remus! What’re you doing! 
 What creature sat in the corner the first time that Harry Potter
                visited my office at Hogwarts! 
 Are you mad...? 
 WHAT CREATURE! 
 A grindylow! 
 We’ve been betrayed. Voldemort knew you were being moved tonight. I
                had to make sure you weren’t an imposter. 
 Who did this to him? 
 Snape. 
 He’ll be fine, Molly. But
                that’s Dark Magic. The damage is done. 
 Someone else is back. 
 The last words Albus Dumbledore spoke to the pair of us? 
 ‘Harry is the best hope we have. Trust him.’ Shacklebolt lowers his
                wand, wheels on Harry. 
 What gave you away? 
 Hedwig -- I think. She was trying to protect me --
 Hey ya -- Well... thanks. 
 Deserves that. Brilliant, he was. Wouldn’t be standing here without
                him. 
 Really? 

                
 Always the tone of surprise. 
 Are we the last? Where’s George? 
 Remus. Where’s my son? 
 How do you feel, Georgie? 
 Saint-like. 
 Come again? 
 Saint-like... You see, I’m holy. Holey, Fred, geddit? 
 With the whole wide world of ear- related humor at your disposal, you
                go for holey? Pathetic. 
 Reckon I’m still better-looking than you. Better-looking thanBill,
                that’s for sure. 
 Mad-Eye’s dead. 
 Mundungus took one look atVoldemort and Disapparated. 
 Mad-Eye reckoned You-Know-Who would expect the real Harry to be with
                the most skilled Auror. He knew he’d be in the most danger. 
 It doesn’t explain how they knew we were moving Harry tonight.
                    
 Wha’? One of us? Tha’s mad. I’d wager me life it wasn’ none of you
                lot. An’ if it was me I’d kno’, wouldn’ I? Talk in me sleep on occasion, I’ll admit,
                but there’s only Fang aroun’ ter hear an’ mostly it’s gibberish an’ besides I’d cut
                me tongue out ‘fore ‘d betray ‘arry e’en in me dreams--
 Wha’s so funny! 
 I trust you with my life, Hagrid. I trust everyone in this room.
                Understood? 
 Understood. 
 ’Ear, ’ear. 
 Better. 

                
 You lied to me, Ollivander! 
 No! No! I believed a different wand would work, I swear! 
 Then explain this! 
 But it makes no sense... 
 Perhaps our friend’s loyalties lie elsewhere, Wormtail. 
 No! There must be a way! I’ll think of something else! 
 I hope so, Ollivander, for your sake. I won’t be so forgiving next
                time... 

                
 Going somewhere? 
 No one else is going to die. Not for me. 
 For you? You think Mad-eye died for you? You think George took that
                curse for you? You may be the Chosen One, mate, but this is a whole lot bigger than
                that. 
 Come with me. Now. 
 And leave Hermione? Are you mad? We wouldn’t last two days without her.
                    
 Don’t tell her I said that. (back to Harry)
                Besides, you’ve still got theTrace on you. And there’s the wedding... 
 Wedding? 
 Bill and Fleur. Mum’s been planning it for months. Only thing that’s
                kept her sane, Ir eckon. She’ll kill me if I miss it. Kill you too. Rather go face
                to face with You-Know-Who if I’m honest. 
 I don’t care about a bloody wedding -- no matter whose it is. I have
                to start searching for the Horcruxes. It’s the only chance we have to beat him. And
                the longer we wait the stronger he gets. 
 Tonight’s not the night, mate. You’d only be doing him a favor. 
 Do you think he knows? 
 I mean, they’re bits of his soul, the Horcruxes. Bits of him. When
                Dumbledore destroyed the ring and you destroyed Tom Riddle’s diary all those years
                ago -- he must’ve felt something right? 
 What I’m saying is, if we do this thing right, if we find the Horcruxes
                and begin to destroy them one by one... 
 Won’t he know he’s being hunted? 

                
 All together now! 
 One. Two. Three! 

                
 Were you going to tell me? 
 Yes. 
 And Ron and Hermione. They’ll not be going back to Hogwarts either?
                    
 I see. 
 Dumbledore didn’t want anyone to know what it is we’re doing. If I
                tell you, I’d be betraying him. 
 Zip me up, will you. 
 Seems silly, doesn’t it? A wedding. Given everything that’s going on. 
 Maybe that’s the best reason to have it. Because of everything that’s
                going on. 
 Morning. 
 How’s it look on your end, boys? 
 Brilliant! 
 Bloody hell, what’s the Minister of Magic doing here? 
 Dunno. But something tells me he didn’t come to give away the bride.
            
 To what do we owe the pleasure, Minister? 
 I think we both know the answer to that question, Mr. Potter.
                    
 And this would be...? 
 Don’t be coy, Mr. Potter. Mr. Weasley. Would you say you were
                close to your former Headmaster? 
 Dumbledore? And me? I dunno. I reckon I was just another Weasley to him.
                He was always polite -- 
 And you, Miss Granger? How would you characterize your
                relationship? 
 We were friendly, not close like Harry, but -- 
 What’s this all about? 
 This. Despite the fact that neither of your friends appear to
                have been particularly close to their recently deceasedHeadmaster, he saw fit to
                remember them in his will. Now why do you suppose that would be? 
 No idea. 
 Come now, you don’t expect me to believe... 
 ‘Herein is set forth the Last Will and Testament of Albus
                Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore. First, to Ronald Bilius Weasley, I leave my
                Deluminator, a device of my own making, in the hope that -- when things seem most
                dark -- it will show him the light.’ 
 Dumbledore left this? For me? Brilliant. Er -- what is it? 
 Wicked. 
 ‘To Miss Hermione Jean Granger, I leave my copy of The Tales of
                Beedle the Bard, in the hope that she will find it entertaining and instructive.’
                    
 Mum used to read me those! The Wizard and the Hopping Pot, Babbitty
                Rabbity and her Cackling Stump... 
 Oh, c’mon! Beedle’s stories are famous! Babbity Rabbitty? No...? 
 ‘To Harry James Potter, I leave the Snitch he caught in his first
                Quidditch match at Hogwarts, as a reminder of the rewards of perseverance and skill.
                    
 That’s it then? 
 Not quite. Dumbledore left you a second bequest: The Sword of
                Godric Gryffindor. Unfortunately, the Sword of Gryffindor was not Dumbledore’s to
                give away. As an important historical artifact, it belongs... 
 To Harry! It belongs to Harry! It chose him! It came to him in the
                Chamber of Secrets when he most needed it! 
 The sword may present itself to any worthy Gryffindor, Miss
                Granger. That does not make it that wizard’s property. And in any event the current
                whereabouts of the sword are unknown. 
 Excuse me? 
 The sword is missing. 
 I
                won’t pretend to be your friend, Mr. Potter. But I assure you I’m not your enemy. 
 You’ll forgive me, Minister. But 
 Dumbledore said something very
 Where is your guard, sir? 
 I came alone. I don’t really need

                
 We want you to be the godfather. 
 You mean -- But that’s brilliant -- I... don’t know what to say. 
 Say yes. Lupin grins, claps Harry on the shoulder and hikes off into
                the darkness, joining the WIZARDS STANDING GUARD in the garden’s deepest shadows.
                Harry looks back to Tonks, then notices a slight, TUFTY-HAIRED WIZARD 
 sitting alone at a table just beyond her. 
 Hello, Harry! LUNA LOVEGOOD approaches in the company of a cross-eyed
                wizard 
 with shoulder-length white hair the
                texture of candy floss. Both wear robes the color of egg yolk. 
 Oh, I’ve interrupted a deep thought, haven’t I? I can see it growing
                smaller in your eyes. 
 No, ’course not. How are you, Luna? 
 Very well. I was bitten by a garden gnome only moments ago. 
 Gnome saliva is enormously beneficial! Xenophilius
                Lovegood. We live just over the hill! 
 Nice to meet you, sir. 
 I trust you know, Mr. Potter, that we at The Quibbler,
                unlike those toadies at the Daily Prophet, fully supported Dumbledore during his
                lifetime and in his death support you just as fully. 
 Come, Daddy. Harry doesn’t want to talk to us right now. He’s just too
                nice to say so. 
 Sir? May I sit down? 
 Mr. Potter! By all means! 
 I found what you wrote in theDaily Prophet very moving, sir. I take it
                you knew Professor Dumbledore well? 
 I certainly knew him the longest, if you don’t count his brother
                Aberforth -- and somehow, people never do seem to count Aberforth. 
 I never even knew he had a brother, sir. 
 Yes, well, Dumbledore was always very private. Even as a boy. 
 Sir, I was wondering if you’d had much contact with him before he
                died. 
 The occasional owl. Though it was strange... 
 Strange, sir? 
 It was the owls themselves. They often arrived in distress. It
                was clear they’d traveled great distances in some cases. 
 Could you tell me from where they’d come, sir? 
 I’m afraid not. Albus’ messages mostly referenced our days
                together as schoolboys. They were surprisingly intimate. When he did speak of his
                current activities his words would turn elliptical. Still, I sensed he was under
                great stress. Why do you ask? 
 Just curious. I was... close to Professor Dumbledore. 
 Well, he treasured you, Mr. Potter, I can attest to that. I can
                also tell you that when a person passes, it’s only natural to rue the things left
                unsaid, to regret the question never asked. I knew Albus nigh on 100 years, but in
                many ways he will always remain a riddle even to me. 

                
 Don’t despair, Elphias. I’m told he’s been thoroughly unriddled
                byRita Skeeter. In 800 pages no less. 
 That woman is a vulture, Muriel, and you well know it. 
 Someone has to pick the bones to get at the truth. I read your
                obituary, Elphias. Lovely. But you did skate over some of the sticky patches in
                Dumbledore’s life. 
 I’m sorry you think so, Muriel. I assure you I was writing from
                the heart. 
 Yes, well, Rita Skeeter hasn’t made that mistake, I’m sure. Word has
                it someone talked to her, someone who knew the Dumbledore family well. You and I
                both know who that is, Elphias. 
 A monstrous betrayal. I can only conclude the rumors are true
                and that she has become untethered. 
 Who are you talking about? 
 Well, I don’t suppose it’ll be a secret once the book comes out.
                    
 Bathilda Bagshot. 
 Who? 
 Who? Bathilda Bagshot! My god, boy, she’s only the most celebrated
                magical historian of the last century. Don’t they read History of Magic at Hogwarts
                anymore? 
 Oh, right. Slipped my mind... 
 She knew the Dumbledores as well as anyone. She’d have letters,
                perhaps an interesting photograph or two. I’m sure Rita Skeeter would have thought
                it well worth a trip to Godric’s Hollow to take a peek into that old bird’s rattled
                cage. 
 Godric’s Hollow? Bathilda Bagshot lives in Godric’s Hollow? 
 For years now. That’s where she first met Dumbledore. 
 Excuse me? You don’t mean to say Dumbledore lived there too? 
 Of course. The family moved thereafter his father killed those three
                Muggles. It was quite the scandal. 
 Honestly, my boy, are
                you sure you knew him at all? 
 The Ministry has fallen. The Minister of Magic is dead. They are
                coming... 
 Nice meeting you, Mr. Potter! 
 Ron! Ron! 
 Harry! Go! Go! 
 Where are we? 
 Shaftesbury Avenue. I used to come here to the theater with my mum
                and dad. Just popped into my head. I don’t know why... 
 This way! 
 We need to change. 
 How the ruddy - 
 Undetectable Extension Charm. 
 You’re amazing, you are. 
 Always the tone of surprise. 
 That’ll be the books. 
 Do you reckon everyone’s alright at the wedding? Maybe we should - 
 They were after you, mate. We’d just put everyone in danger going back. 
 Ron’s right. Cappuccino, please. 
 What she said. 
 Same. 
 Wicked scar. 

                
 So where do we go from here? The Leaky Cauldron? 
 Too dangerous. If Voldemort’s taken over the Ministry, none of the
                old places are safe. 
 My rucksack. With all my things. I left it back at the Burrow -
 You’re joking. 
 I’ve had the essentials packed for days. Just in case. 
 By the way -- these jeans? Not my favorite. Bit tight. 
 DOWN! 
 Stupefy! 
 Expulsio! 
 Petrificus Totalus! 
 Go. 
 Lock the door, get the lights. 
 This one’s name is Rowle. He was on the Astronomy Tower the night
                Snape killed Dumbledore. 
 This is Dolohov. I recognize him from the wanted posters. 
 So what do we do with you, huh? Kill us if it was turned round, wouldn’t
                you? 
 Suppose it’s him that did Mad-Eye. How would you feel then? 
 It’s better we wipe their memories. We kill them, they’ll know we were
                here. 
 You’re the boss. 
 Hermione? 
 You’re the best with spells. 
 Obliviate. 
 How is it they knew we were there? 
 Maybe you still have the Trace on you. 
 Can’t be. The Trace breaks at seventeen. It’s Wizarding law. 
 What? 
 We didn’t celebrate your birthday, Harry. Ginny and I -- we’d
                prepared a cake. We were going to bring it out at the end of the wedding... 
 Hermione. I appreciate the thought -- honestly. But given that we were
                almost killed by a couple of Death Eaters a few minutes ago... 
 Right. Perspective. 
 We’ve got to get off the streets, get somewhere safe. 
 I have an idea. 

                
 Severus Snape? 
 Mad-Eye...? 
 What was that about? 
 Mad-eye’s doing, I’d guess. In case Snape decided to come snooping.
                    
 Homenum revelio. 
 It’s a spell to reveal human presence. 
 We’re alone. 

                
 Lumos. 

                
 Dear Sirius. Thank you for Harry’s birthday
                present. You’d think he’d been born on a broom. James says he’s got the look of
                aSeeker, but then James would. We had a very quiet birthday tea, just us and old
                Bathilda, who dotes on Harry. Wormy dropped by late in the day, but seemed down and
                didn’t stay long. James is frustrated being shut up here, but Dumbledore’s still got
                hisInvisibility Cloak, so he doesn’t have much choice. By the way, Bathilda tells
                the most amazing stories about our old Headmaster. I don’t know how much to believe.
                Can it really be true that Dumbledore -

                
 Harry! Harry! 
 Ron! I’ve found him! Good! git! 

                
 Tell him from me he’s a 
 Harry, you can’t just disappear. We thought -
 It’s from your Mum. To Sirius. Bathilda Bagshot...? 
 Yeah. They knew her. She wrote A History of Magic, you know. 

                
 Did she now? 
 I’m thinking maybe we should go talk to her. She still lives in
                Godric’s Hollow. I’m thinking maybe she could help us. 
 Harry. I can imagine why you’d want to go there, but... I don’t
                think Bathilda Bagshot is going to know where Voldemort hid his Horcruxes. 

                
 Hey! I think you two better comedown here. 
 The two clinging to the tree areDeath Eaters for sure. Dunno ‘bout the
                bloke on the bench. 
 Can’t see us, of course. But
                we’ll have to be careful coming and going. C’mon. There’s something else you need to
                see. 
 Lovely. 
 Regulus Arcturus Black...? 
 R... A... B. 
 To the Dark Lord. I know I will be dead long before you read this... I
                have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy it... 
 R.A.B. was Sirius’ brother? We see the trio from the strange LOW POV
                again, sitting round the kitchen table. SLOPPY STACKS of OLD DAILY PROPHETS surround
                them. 
 Yes. Question is, did he actually destroy the real Horcrux? 

                
 Stop! I order you! 
 Kreacher... 
 Been spying on us, have you? 
 Kreacher has been... watching. Kreacher always watches. 
 Maybe he knows. 
 Ever seen this before? 
 Kreacher, I own this place. Sirius left it to me. Which means I own
                you too. 
 That was Master Regulus’ locket. 
 That’s right. But there were two, weren’t there? 
 Where’s the other one? 
 Kreacher doesn’t know where the other locket is. 
 But was it here? Did you ever see it? 
 Filthy Mudblood -- The Death Eaters will soon be coming for you!
                    

                
 Blood-traitor Weasley - 
 Ron! RON! 
 Answer her. 
 Yes. It was here, in this house. A most evil object... 
 How do you mean? 
 Before he died, Master Regulus ordered Kreacher to destroy it. It
                was the last thing he asked of Kreacher. But no matter how Kreacher tried, he could
                not.. 
 Where is it now? Did someone take it, Kreacher? 

                
 He came in the night. He took many things, including the
                locket. 
 Who, Kreacher? Who was it? 
 Mundungus. Mundungus Fletcher. 
 Find him. 
 As your new Minister for Magic, I promise to restore this temple
                of tolerance to its former glory. Therefore, beginning today, each employee will be
                required to submit themselves for evaluation. But know this: You have nothing to
                fear... as long as you have nothing to hide... As Thicknesse smiles, a GANG of DARK
                WIZARDS 
 emerge into the atrium, pushing a BLOODIED MAN
                before them. The crowd STIRS uneasily and we... 
 My father will hear about this. 
 He’s not here, you fools. 
 They have flesh memories. 

            
 Snitches. They’re never touched by bare skin until the Seeker
                captures it. Even the wizard who fabricates it wears gloves. That way, if there’s a
                dispute, the Snitch can identify who first touched it. 
 You mean... it remembers me? 

                
 When Scrimgeour first gave it to you, I thought it might open
                at your touch -- that Dumbledore had hidden something in it. 
 Harry Potter! So long it’s been -
 Expelliarmus! 
 As requested, Kreacher has returned with the thief Mundungus
                Fletcher! 
 Dobby has also returned with the thief Mundungus Fletcher! 
 What are you playing at -- setting a pair of bleedin’ ‘ouse-elves
                on me! 
 Dobby was only trying to help! Dobby saw Kreacher in Diagon Alley,
                which Dobby thought was curious. And then Dobby heard Kreacher mention Harry
                Potter’s name, which Dobby thought was very curious. And then Dobby saw that
                Kreacher was talking to the thief Mundungus Fletcher, which Dobby thought was very,
                very - 
 I’m no thief, you foul little git. I’m a purveyer of rare and
                wondrous objects - 
 You’re a thief, Dung. Everyone knows it. 
 Master Weasley! So good to see you again! 
 Wicked trainers. 
 Listen, I panicked that night, all right? I never volunteered to
                die for you, mate. Can I help it ifMad-Eye fell off his broom - 
 Stop lying! 
 Piece of advice. Let’s not rehash old times. Got it... mate? 
 When you turned this place over -- don’t deny it! --you found a
                locket, am I right? 
 Why? Was it valuable? 
 You’ve still got it. 
 No. He’s worried he should have got more money for it. 
 Wouldn’t be difficult, would it? Bleedin’ gave it away, din’ I?
                There I was, pitching me wares in Diagon Alley when some ministry hag comes up and
                asks to see my license. Says she’s of a mind to lock me up and would’ve, too, she
                hadn’ taken a fancy to that locket. 
 Who was she? This witch? 
 Well, she’s right there, in’t she? Bleedin’ bow an’ all. 
 Right.So let’s do it. Who gets who? * 
 Well, unless one of you fancies wearing a skirt... 
 Remember what we said. Keep your eyes down. Don’t speak to anyone
                unless absolutely necessary. Act as normal as possible. Just do what you see
                everyone else doing. We do that -- and with a bit of luck -- we get ourselves
                inside. And then... Ron 
 It gets really tricky. 
 Correct. 
 This is completely mental. 
 Completely, utterly, without question. 
 The world’s mental. Come on, drink up. We’ve got a Horcrux to find.
            
 In case you’re interested, I’m Reg Cattermole, Magical
                Maintenance Department. 
 Mafalda Hopkirk, assistant in the Improper Use of
                Magic Office. 
 I’m nobody. 
 You’re somebody. Be careful. 
 Morning, Reg! Good luck today. 
 Oh... yeah. Thanks. 
 What do you reckon he meant by ‘Good luck.’? 
 We flush ourselves in? 
 Apparently so. 
 That’s bloody disgusting. 
 Are those...? 

                
 Muggles. In their rightful place. 
 Move it, will you -- oh, Runcorn! Forgive me... 
 You appear to be quite popular. 
 I gotta tell you, I'm starting to freak out a bit. 
 The Ministry must be hiring young these days. 
 hey’re not Ministry. They’reSnatchers. They hunt
                Muggle-borns and blood-traitors for a price. 
 How long did you say this batch of Polyjuice Potion
                would last, Hermione? 
 I didn’t. 
 Cattermole! 
 It’s still raining in my office. Two days now. 
 Really? Have you tried an umbrella? 
 You do realize I'm on my way downstairs, don’t you, Cattermole? 
 Downstairs...? 
 To interrogate your wife! If my wife’s blood status were in doubt and
                the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement needed a job doing, I think
                I’d make it a priority. You’ve got one hour. 
 Oh my god. What am I going to do? My wife’s all alone
                downstairs? 
 Ron. You don’t have a wife. 
 Oh. Right. 
 Look, we’ll go with you -- 
 No, that’s mad. You two find Umbridge. I’ll be fine. But
                how do I stop it raining? 
 Try Finite Incantatem. Of course if something’s gone
                wrong with an Atmospheric Charm -- 

                
 Level Two. Department of MagicalLaw Enforcement, including
                Wizengamot Administration Services, Auror Headquarters and Improper Use of Magic
                Department. 
 This is you. 
 Finite Incantatem, okay. And if that doesn’t work...?
                    
 I don’t like him being on his own down there. 
 Ron’s been coming here since he was two years old. It’s
                us you should be worrying about. 
 You really have horrible teeth, you know that. 

                
 Level One. Minister of Magic and Support Staff... 

                
 I say if we don’t locate Umbridge within the hour,
                we go find Ron and come back another day. Deal? The grilles clang open again and
                Harry and Hermione freeze. 
 Ah, Mafalda! Travers sent you, did he? Good. We’ll go straight
                down. 
 Albert, aren’t you getting out? 

                
 Weasley! 
 They’re waiting for your report downstairs. 
 Oh, yes... of course. 
 Reckon the old hag will be interrogating Mudbloods all day? 
 Sh...careful. 
 Runcorn. 
 Accio locket. 

                
 All right, all right. Let’s calm down, shall we? 
 It probably just snuck up here from Experimental Charms. I
                think none of us will soon forget last month’s Poisonous Duck... Seeing the
                Red-Haired Witch’s expression, the Balding Wizard turns and, as before, withers at
                the sight of Harry. 
 R-Runcorn. 
 M-morning. 
 Ron, it’s me. 
 Harry! Blimey, I forgot what you looked like. Where’s
                Hermione? 
 She went down to the courtrooms with Umbridge -- The
                grilles open again and reveal... Arthur Weasley, in the company of an elderly witch
                    
. 
 I understand, Wakinda, but I can’t be a party to that. 
 Hello, Reg. Isn’t Mary in for questioning today? Try to have
                faith. If there’s anything Molly and I can do for you --
 Let me guess. It’s raining in Yaxley’s office again? 
 Tell him to try an umbrella. 
 Arthur! You know you’re being tracked, don’t you?
                    
 Is that a threat, Runcorn? 
 No, Arthur. It’s a fact. They’re watching you. 
 I’ll tell you later. Let’s find Hermione. 
 Bloody cold down here. 
 I’m half-blood, I tell you! My father was a wizard! Look him up!
                William Alderton! He worked here for thirty years... 
 What is it? 
 It’s here... 
 Reg... 
 Mary Elizabeth Cattermole? 
 Yes. 
 Mother to Maisie, Ellie andAlfred? Wife to Reginald? 
 Yes. 
 A wand was taken from you upon your arrival at the Ministry today,
                Mrs. Cattermole. Is this that wand? 
 Would you please tell the court from which witch or wizard you took
                this wand. 
 But I didn’t take it. I got it in Diagon Alley, at
                Ollivander’s, when I was eleven. It chose me. 
 No, no, I don’t think so, Mrs. Cattermole. Wands only choose
                witches. And you are not a witch. 
 But I am! Tell them, Reg! Tell them what I am! 
 What the devil are you doing, Albert? 
 You’re lying. And one mustn’t tell lies, Dolores...
                Stupefy! 
 EXPECTO PATRONUM! 
 Relashio! 
 You? It’s you! Reg, it’s HarryPotter! 
 ‘Tis, isn’t it? This’ll be one to tell the kids. 
 Harry Potter...? 
 Harry Potter. 
 Harry... they’ve seen you. We’ve got to get out of here. 
 Mary. Go home. Get the kids. I’ll... I’ll meet you there.
                We have to get out the country, understand? 
 Mary! Do as I say! 
 I’m sorry. It’s just -
 MARY! 
 Long story. Nice meeting you. 
 Piss off. 
 Seal the exits! Now! 
 Harry, quickly, in my bag, there’s a small bottle labeled ‘Essence
                of Dittany.’ 
 Quickly! 
 Accio Dittany. 
 Unstopper it. 
 Hermione. His arm - 
 Just do it! 
 What happened? I thought we were going back to Grimmauld Place. 
 We were. We were there. But Yaxley had hold of me. I knew we
                couldn’t stay once he’d seen, so when he let go I brought us here. Ron got
                Splinched. I’m... sorry. 
 Don’t be stupid. 
 It’s all I feel safe doing. 
 Salvio Hexia... Protego Totalum... 
 What’re you doing? 
 Protective enchantments. I don’t fancy another visit like we had
                onShaftesbury Avenue, do you? Especially with Ron like this. You can get going on
                the tent... 
 Tent? Where am I supposed to find -
 Repello Muggletum... Muffliato... 
 How’re the mushrooms? Seem to be the only edible things growing
                round here. 
 They’re great. 
 Make sure to leave some for Ron. 

                
 No problem. 
 How bad is he? 
 He’ll be alright in a few days. Hopefully. If we could take him to
                Hogwarts, to Madam Pomfrey -
 So where do we go next? 
 Dumbledore had a theory. He felt that the Horcruxes would not be made
                out of random objects. And he felt they wouldn’t be hidden randomly either. We know
                of three so far. The ring, which according to Dumbledore belonged to TomRiddle’s
                grandfather. The diary, which belonged to Tom himself. And this, which -- again,
                according to Dumbledore -- belonged to his mother. 
 It scares me a bit, that, thinking it’s a piece of Vol- 
 No, don’t! Don’t say it! 
 It’s taboo -- You-Know-Who’s name. That’s how they track people now.
                It’s how they found us in the cafe that night. 
 How d’you know? 
 I overheard a bloke from the Enforcement office talking about it at the
                Ministry. Blimey, what’s that smell? 

                
 Dinner? 
 Not bloody likely. Smells like something Ginny would cook. 
 Tea? 
 Is that it? 
 I know. I felt it too. 
 It’s... it’s
                like it’s ticking or something, like it has a tiny metal heart, like it’s - 
 ... alive. 
 I hate it. It’s like he’s here with us. 
 That’s why we’re going to kill it. 
 Dissendium! 
 Incendio! 
 Expulso! 
 Confringo! 
 It’s angry. 
 What’re you doing? 
 We have to keep it safe until we can figure out how to destroy it. 
 I can put it in my bag - 
 No. 
 Seems strange, mate. Dumbledore sends you off to find a load of
                Horcruxes, but doesn’t bother to tell you how to destroy them. Doesn’t that bother
                you? 

                
 Tell me, Gregorovitch. Tell me where it is... 
 I told you! I no longer have it! It was stolen from me! Many
                years ago! 
 You wouldn’t be lying to me, would you, Gregorovitch? Because, I
                must tell you... that will only make it worse for you...

                
 I speak the truth! I remember like it was yesterday... 
 Who was he? The thief? 
 Just a boy! Not of the village. It was he who took it. I never
                saw it again. I swear on my life. 
 I believe you... 
 I thought it had stopped. 
 You can’t let him in, Harry. Dumbledore himself said it. You have
                to close your mind. It’s too dangerous - 
 It’s not a candle I can blow out, Hermione. It always burns, even if
                it’s just a flicker. Can you understand that? 
 Tell me. What you saw. 
 He’s found him. Vol-
 You-Know-Who. He’s found 
 The wandmaker? 
 Yes. How’d you know? 
 Viktor got his wand from Gregorovitch. Most Durmstrang students did
                at one time. What’s he got to do with You-Know-Who? 
 You-Know-Who wants something Gregorovitch once had -- dunno what. But
                he’s desperate to have it. It’s as if his life depends on it. 
 Don’t -- It... comforts him. 
 Well it sets my teeth on edge. What’s he expecting to hear? Good news? 
 I think he just hopes he doesn’t hear bad news. It gets him through
                the day. 
 And what gets you through the day? 
 We’ve all made sacrifices, Harry. 
 How long before he can travel? 
 I don’t know. It takes time. I’m doing all I can. 
 You’re not doing enough. 
 Take it off. 
 Take it off. Now. 
 Better? 
 Loads. 
 It’s cold. Even though it’s been lying against your skin for days.
                    
 We’ll take turns. Okay? 

                
 ... Severus Snape, newly appointed Headmaster of Hogwarts...
                    

                
 What’s that? That... smell? 

                
 Snatchers. 
 Good to know your enchantments work. 
 He could smell it. My perfume. 
 We have to leave. We’re not safe 
 I told you. Ron’s not strong
 Then we’ll go by foot. 
 I’m hungry. 
 What? 
 I’m hungry. 

            
 We’re all hungry. 
 Leave it. 
 Mum can make food appear out ofthin air. 

                
 No one can conjure food out ofthin air. Food is the first of
                the five Principal Exceptions toGamp’s Law. The other four are - 

                
 Oh, speak English, can’t you? 
 I said leave it. 
 It’ll be dark soon. We need to find a place to sleep. 
 Good plan. 
 Yeah. Brilliant. Only, correct me if I’m wrong... wasn’t that
                yesterday’s plan? And the day before that? And the day before that? Walk. Sleep.
                Walk. Sleep. 
 My turn. 
 He doesn’t know what he’s doing, does he? A frown creases Hermione’s
                forehead as she studies Ron, then she glances at Harry, a trace of doubt in her
                eyes. 
 None of us do. 
 Wizards were here. 
 I don’t like this place. Harry and Ron both turn, look at her. 
 I want to go. 
 Oh my god... 

                
 What? 
 I’ll tell you in a minute. 
 Maybe you could tell me now. 
 Alright. The Sword of Gryffindor? It’s Goblin made. 
 Brilliant. 
 You don’t understand. Dirt and rust have no effect on the blade.
                    
 O-kay. 
 Harry. You already destroyed one Horcrux, right? Tom Riddle’s diary
                -- in the Chamber of Secrets. 
 With a basilisk fang. If you tell me you’ve got one of those in that
                bloody beaded bag of yours - 
 Don’t you see! In the Chamber of Secrets, you stabbed the basilisk
                with the Sword of Gryffindor. Its blade is impregnated with basilisk venom. 
 It only takes in that which makes it stronger... 
 Exactly! Which means... 
 ...it can destroy Horcruxes. 
 Which is why Dumbledore left it to you in his will. 
 You’re brilliant, Hermione. Truly. 
 Actually, I’m highly logical, which allows me to look past the
                extraneous detail and perceive clearly that which others overlook. 
 There’s only one problem... 
 The sword was stolen. 
 Yeah, I’m still here. But you two carry on. Don’t let me spoil your fun.
                    
 What’s the problem? 
 Problem? There’s no problem. Not according to you, anyway. 
 Look, don’t be shy. If you’ve got something to say, spit it out.
                    
 All right, I’ll spit it out. Don’t expect me to skip up and down because
                now there’s some other damn thing we’ve got to find. 

                
 Ron... 
 I thought you knew what you signed up for. 
 Yeah, I thought I did too. 
 I don’t understand. What part of this isn’t living up to your
                expectations? Did you think we’d be staying in five-star hotels? Finding a Horcrux
                every other day? Did you think you’d be back toMummy by Christmas? 
 No, I just reckoned after all this time, we’d have actually achieved
                something. I reckoned you knew what you were doing. I reckoned Dumbledore had told
                you something worthwhile! I reckoned you had a plan! 
 I’ve told you everything Dumbledore told me! And in case you haven’t
                noticed, we’ve found a Horcrux! 
 Yeah, and we’re about as near getting rid of it as we are to finding the
                rest of them, aren’t we! 
 Take it off, Ron. Please take it off. You wouldn’t be talking like
                this if you hadn’t been wearing it all day - 
 Yeah, he would. D’you think I haven’t noticed the two of you
                whispering behind my back? D’you think I haven’t guessed what you were thinking? 
 Harry, we weren’t - 
 Don’t lie! You said it, too, you said you were disappointed - 
 I didn’t! Not like that! Harry -- I didn’t! 
 Do you know why I listen to that radio, every night? Do you! To make
                sure I don’t hear Ginny’s name or Fred or George or Mum or - 
 You think I don’t listen! You think I don’t know what it’s like - 
 NO! YOU DON’T KNOW WHAT IT’S LIKE! YOUR PARENTS ARE DEAD! YOU HAVE NO
                FAMILY! 
 Stop! Stop! 
 Go then. But leave that. 
 And you? 
 Me? 
 Are you staying? Or coming? 
 Fine. I get it. I saw you two the other night. Yeah, that’s right.
                Didn’t know I knew, did you? 
 What? Ron, no -- please -
 He’s gone. 
 Salvio Hexia... Protego Totalum... 
 It’s a Muggle station. 
 Hermione. 
 You were right. It’s like you said. Snitches have flesh memories. But
                I didn’t catch my first Snitch with my hand. I almost swallowed it. 
 ‘I open at the close?’ 
 What do you reckon it means? 
 I don’t know. But look, I’ve found something as well... 
 I thought it was a picture of an eye, but now I don’t think it is.
                It isn’t a rune and it’s not in Spellman’s Syllabary either. And it’s been inked in
                -- somebody drew it -- it isn’t part of the book. 
 Luna’s dad was wearing that, at Ron 
 At
                Bill and Fleur’s wedding. 
 What d’you mean -- wearing it? 
 Around his neck. Like an amulet. I didn’t think much of it at the
                time. You know Luna -- she’s always got some mad thing or the other she’s carrying
                around. I just figured it ran in the family. 
 Why would someone have drawn it in a children’s book? 
 Hermione, I’ve been thinking. I -- I want to go to Godric’s Hollow.
                It’s where I was born, it’s where my parents died - 
 And it’s exactly where You-Know- Who will expect you to go. Because
                it means something to you. 
 But it means something to him too, Hermione. You-Know-Who nearly died
                there. Wouldn’t that be just the kind of place he’d hide a Horcrux? 
 It’s dangerous, Harry. But I have to admit, recently even I’ve been
                thinking we might have to go. I think it’s possible something else is hidden there.
                    
 The sword. If Dumbledore didn’t want it falling
                into theMinistry’s hands, but wanted you to find it, what better place to hide it
                than the birthplace of the founder of Gryffindor himself? 
 Godric’s Hollow is the birthplace of Godric Gryffindor -- I mean,
                ’course it is. Obvious, isn’t it? 

                
 Harry, did you ever even open A History of
                Magic? 
 Tossed it at Neville once when he was snoring -- might’ve popped open.
                    
 Hermione... 
 Don’t ever let me give you a haircut again. 
 I still think we should’ve used Polyjuice Potion. 
 No. This is where I was born. I’m not returning as someone else.
                    
 Harry, I think it’s Christmas Eve! Listen... 
 Do you think they’d be in there? My mum and dad? 
 Yeah. I think they would. 
 Harry. 
 Is it -- ? 
 No. But look. 
 Did you know he had a sister? 
 No. 

            
 Lumos. 
 Ignotus... Hey, Har - 

            
 Happy Christmas, Hermione. 
 Happy Christmas, Harry. 
 Harry... 
 Yeah. 
 Someone’s watching us. By the gate. 
 C’mon. 
 I don’t think this is a good idea. 
 We look like ordinary Muggles. 
 Muggles who’ve just been laying flowers on your parents’ grave.
                    
 Relax. This is right. I know it. 
 Omigod. Harry... 
 This is where they died, Hermione.
 You’re Bathilda, aren’t you? 
 Harry, I’m not sure about this. 
 Hermione, she knew Dumbledore. She might have the sword. Besides,
                she’s barely knee-high to a house-elf. I think we can overpower her if it turns
                ugly. 
 There’s something odd about her. And what’s that smell? 
 She’s gaga, remember? 
 Here. Let me do that. 
 You have a lovely house, Miss Bagshot. Hermione eyes a PHOTOGRAPH
                of a CURIOUSLY COMPELLING YOUNG GIRL 
, then runs a finger along
                a table. It comes away thick with dust. She frowns, looks up, finds Bathilda
                watching her. 
 Miss Bagshot? Who is this man? 
 His name. Can you tell me his name? 
 This is him, Hermione. The one I saw in Gregorovitch’s wand shop. The
                thief. Miss Bagshot, who is he? 
 She wants us to go upstairs. 
 All right... 
 She wants me to go. Alone. 
 Why? 
 It’s all right. You stay here. 
 Harry... 
 Lumos. 

                
 You are Potter? 

                
 Yes. 

                
 (in Parseltongue) I have something for you... 

                
 Harry! 
 Confringo! 

                
 Harry... Harry, can you hear me...? 

                
 Yes. 

                
 Good. That’s good... 

                
 We got away. 

                
 Yes. 

                
 Are you alright? 

                
 I’m fine. But you’ve been sick. Rest... Rest a bit more...
                    

                
 You’ve outdone yourself this time. Hermione turns, finds Harry
                standing outside the tent, admiring the view. He looks pale, battle-worn. 
 The Forest of Dean. I came here once with my mum and dad, years
                ago. It’s just how I remember it. The trees. The river. It’s like nothing’s changed.
                Not true, of course. Everything’s changed. If I brought my parents here, they
                wouldn’t recognize any of it. Not the trees. Not the river. Not... me. 
 Where are they? 
 Wendell and Monica Wilkens now reside happily in Sydney, Australia.
                They have two dogs, run a small sweet shop, but floss daily. No children. She
                smiles, then it fades. 
 Maybe we should just stay here, Harry. Grow old. Harry has no
                words. She inhales, shakes off her tears. 
 You wanted to know who the boy in the photograph was. Well, I know.
                    
 It was in Bathilda’s sitting room. Rita Skeeter had sent it to her.
                Harry, it doesn’t make for very nice reading - 
 Who is he, Hermione? The thief? Did Dumbledore know him? 
 Yes. 
 Well? 
 For a time. 
 Tell me, Hermione. Who is he? 
 Gellert Grindelwald. He’s not very well known in Britain, but there
                was a time, before You-Know-Who... 
 Hermione, I don’t need to have read A History of Magic to know who
                Gellert Grindelwald is. Hermione nods, hands him the book, open to a PHOTOGRAPH of a
                TEENAGED DUMBLEDORE laughing with another BOY
. The
                caption: “For the Greater Good? Dark Days; Dumbledore and Grindelwald.” On the
                opposite page is a PHOTOGRAPH of Grindelwald in later days, clad in black, holding a
                JAGGED WAND -- no longer the carefree lad of youth. 
 When Grindelwald was seventeen, he was expelled from Durmstrang.
                He’d started doing some twisted things at school -- experiments. A few teachers had
                always protected him, but they couldn’t anymore. After he left, he traveled for
                awhile, then ended up in Godric’s Hollow where his great aunt lived, Bathilda
                Bagshot. 
 Get to the hard part, Hermione. 
 She introduced him to Dumbledore. It made sense. Dumbledore’s
                mother had just died, Grindelwald was troubled and they were both brilliant --
                they’d never really had anyone they could talk to ont he same level. They did a lot
                of talking that summer. But they always returned to one particular subject. 
 Wizard rule over Muggles. 
 And Dumbledore believed in it? 
 Yes. 
 ‘For the Greater Good.’ What does that mean? 
 It was something Dumbledore came up with. He believed wizards were
                superior and should rule overMuggles, but gently, for their own good. Grindelwald
                took a more violent position. 
 It was a different time, Harry. It was one summer. Dumbledore was
                young - 
 We’re young, Hermione. And here we are, risking our lives to fight
                against the very thing Dumbledore supported. 
 He changed, Harry. Years later, it was Dumbledore who put
                Grindelwald in prison. 
 Where’s my wand? I’ll take the watch. 
 Hermione. Where’s my wand? 
 It’s my fault. As we were leaving Godric’s Hollow, I cast a curse
                and it rebounded... I’m sorry, Harry, I tried to mend it but wands are different - 
 It’s done. 
 Maybe we can - 
 It’s done. 
 Leave me yours. You get back in the warm. And give me that. 
 He loved you, Harry. I know he loved you. 
 No... 
 Lumos! 
 Accio Sword. 
 Diffindo. 
 Hermione... 
 Are -- you --mental? 
 It was you! 
 Well, yeah. Bit obvious, I'd think. 
 And the doe. That was you as well. 
 No. I reckoned it was you. 
 My Patronus is a stag. 
 Right. Antlers. 
 You didn’t see anyone else? 
 No, I... I did think maybe I saw something -- when I was running -- over
                there --
 Anything? 

                
 But I reckon whoever cast the doe, put the sword in
                that pool hoping we’d find it. 
 And we did, didn’t we? 
 See that? It knows. It’s afraid. 
 Do it. 
 What? No. Harry. That thing’s bad for me. I can’t handle it. I’m not
                making excuses for how I acted, but that thing affects me more than it affects you
                and Hermione. It made me think stuff -- stuff I was thinking anyway, but it made
                everything worse. 
 All the more reason. 
 No. I can’t -- 
 Then why are you here? Why did you come back? 
 I’ll have to speak to it in order for it to open. When it does, don’t
                hesitate. I don’t know what’s in here, but it’ll put up a fight. The bit of Riddle
                that was in his diary tried to kill me. 
 On three. One. Two. Three. 
 Take me
                inside... 
 Stab it, Ron. Now. 

                
 I have seen your heart and it is mine... 
 Don’t listen to it. 

                
 I have seen your dreams, Ronald Weasley, and I have seen your
                fears... 
 Ron. Don’t listen to it! 

                
 Least loved, by the mother who craved a daughter. Least loved,
                by the girl who prefers your friend... 
 Ron. Stab it! 
 We were better without you, happier without you. 
 Who could look at you beside Harry Potter? What are you,
                compared with the Chosen One...? 
 Ron. It lies! Stab it! STAB IT! 
 Your mother confessed that she would have preferred me as a
                son... 
 Who wouldn’t prefer him, what woman would take you, you are
                nothing, nothing, nothing to him... 
 Do it, Ron! Kill it! 

            
 After you left, she cried for a week. She’s like my sister. 
 I’m sorry. I’m sorry I left. 
 You’ve sort of made up for it tonight. Getting the sword. Finishing
                off the Horcrux. 
 Saving your life. 
 That too. 
 And just think of it. Only three to go. 

                
 Hermione! 
 Everything all right? 
 Fine. Actually... more than fine. 
 Hey. 
 Wo -- hey -- ouch! 

                
 You -- complete --arse -- Ronald -- Weasley! You
                crawl back here after all these weeks and say, ‘Hey?’ (turning to Harry) Where’s my
                wand? Harry, where’s my wand! 
 Um... I don’t know? 
 Harry Potter, you give me my wand! 
 How come he’s got your wand? 
 Never mind why he’s got my wand -
 What is
                that? 
 You destroyed it? 
 And exactly how is it you have theSword of Gryffindor? 
 It’s a long story. 
 Don’t think this changes anything. 
 No, of course not. I only destroyed a bloody freaking Horcrux! Why would
                that change anything! Do you know what it was like for me to hear those words coming
                from you! To see you doing those things -
 See me doing what things? 
 What happened out there? 

                
 It’s a long story. 
 Look, I wanted to come back the minute I’d left. I just... didn’t know
                how to find you. 
 Exactly how did you find us? 
 With this. 
 It doesn’t just turn off lights. I don’t know exactly how it works, but
                Christmas morning I -- I was sleeping -- in this little pub-- I’d given some
                Snatchers the slip the night before, me being a blood- traitor and all -- anyway, I
                was sleeping when I heard it... 
 It? 
 A voice. 
 Your voice, Hermione. Coming out of this. 
 And what may I ask did I say? 
 My name. Just my name. Like a whisper. 
 So I took this and I clicked it and this tiny ball of light appeared.
                And I knew. 
 Knew what? 
 Just knew. On account of Hermione’s voice. And sure enough, it floated
                toward me, the ball of light, right to my chest and then -- went straight through--
                right here. 
 I could feel it inside me. It was warm, like the first sip of a good cup
                of tea. And I knew it would take me where I needed to go. So I Disapparated and came
                out on this hillside. It was dark. I didn’t have any idea where I was. I just had to
                hope one of you would show yourselves in the end. And you did. 
 I’ve always liked it. These flames Hermione makes. 
 How long you reckon she’ll stay mad at me? 
 Keep talking ‘bout that little ball of light touching your heart --
                she’ll come round. 
 It was true. Every word. 
 You’re going to think I’m
                mental, but I think that’s why Dumbledore left it to me -- the Deluminator. I think
                he knew that at some point I’d... need to find my way back. And she’d lead me.
                    
 Bloody hell. I just realized.
 Yeah... 
 Well, I’ve got one. Here. It’s Blackthorn, ten inches, nothing special,
                but I reckon it’ll do. I took it off a Snatcher a few weeks back.
                    
 Don’t tell Hermione, but they’re a bit dim, Snatchers.
                This one was definitely part Troll. The smell off him... 
 Engorgio. 
 Wo. 
 Reducio! 
 What’s going on in there? 
 Nothing. 

                
 Maybe a bit more practice, eh? 
 We need to talk. 
 All right. 

                
 I want to go and see Xenophilius Lovegood. 
 Sorry? 
 See this? It’s a letter Dumbledore wrote to Grindelwald. Look at
                the signature. It’s the mark again. 
 It keeps cropping up. Here. In Beedle the Bard. In the graveyard in
                Godric’s Hollow -- what? 
 Jesus. It was there too. 
 Where? 
 Outside Gregorovitch’s wand shop. on the alley wall... 
 But what does it mean? 
 Harry, you don’t have a clue where the next Horcrux is. And neither
                do I. But this, this means something. I’m sure of it. 
 I think Hermione’s right. I think we ought to go and see Lovegood. What
                say we vote on it? Those in favor... 
 Sorry, Harry. Looks like it’s Hermione and me this time. 
 Not still mad at him, are you? 
 I’m always mad at him. 
 Luna? 
 Luna. 
 Keep off the dirigible plums. 

                
 What is it? (to Ron) Who are you? (to Harry) What do you
                want --
 Hello, Mr. Lovegood. I’m Harry Potter. We met a few months back?
                    
 Would it be okay if we came in? It won’t take long, sir. I promise.
            
 Excuse me. 
 So. What brings you here, Mr. Potter? 
 Well, sir, we need some help. 
 Ah. Help. I see. Yes, well, the thing is, helping Harry
                Potter, rather dangerous these days... 
 Aren’t you the one who keeps telling everyone it’s their first duty to
                help Harry? 
 I have expressed that view, yes. In the past. Would you
                excuse me one moment. I shall return shortly and, um, try to help you... 
 What’s going on here? 
 He’s mental. Let’s face it. Luna’s always good value, but she’s nutty as
                squirrel poo. 
 Do you see that? 
 Well, yeah, of course. It’s massive, isn’t it? 
 No! Don’t go near it! 
 It’s an Erumpent horn. It’s a Class B Tradeable Material. 
 Yeah, all right... 
 May I offer you all an infusion of Gurdyroots? We make
                it ourselves. 
 Where is Luna, sir? 
 Luna? Oh, um, she’ll be along. Now how can I help you,
                Mr. Potter? 
 Well, sir, it’s about something you were wearing around your neck at
                the wedding. A symbol... 
 You mean this? 
 Yes! Exactly. What we wondered, sir, is, well, what is it? 
 What is it? Well, it’s the sign of the Deathly Hallows,
                of course. 
 The what? 
 The Deathly Hallows. I assume you’re all familiar with
                ‘The Tale of the Three Brothers?’ 
 Yes. No. 
 It’s in here. 
 Well, there’s no real reason to go on unless one is
                familiar with the tale. Why don’t you read it aloud, Miss...? 
 Granger. Well... all right. 
 There
                were once three brothers who were traveling along a lonely, winding road at twilight
                - 
 Midnight. Mum always said midnight. 

                But twilight’s fine. Better actually. 
 In time, the brothers reached a river too treacherous to pass...
                    

            

                
 But being learned in the magical arts, the three brothers simply
                waved their wands and made a bridge. They were halfway across it when they found
                their path blocked by a hooded figure. 

                
 It was Death and he felt cheated, for travelers usually drowned
                in the river. But Death was cunning. He granted each brother a wish for their
                cleverness. The oldest, who was a combative man, asked for a wand more powerful than
                any in existence. So Death fashioned one from an elder tree on the banks of the
                river. 

                
 The second brother, who was an arrogant man, asked for the power
                to recall others from Death. So Death plucked a stone from the river. Finally Death
                turned to the third brother. A humble man, he asked for something that would make
                him disappear. And so it was that Death handed over his own Cloak of Invisibility.
                Death then stepped aside and the brothers went their separate ways... 

                
 The first brother traveled to a distant village where, with
                ElderWand in hand, he killed a wizard with whom he had once quarreled. Proceeding to
                an Inn, he bragged of his invincibility. But that very night... 

                
 ... another wizard crept upon him as he lay sleeping. He took
                the Elder Wand... and slit the brother’s throat for good measure. And so Death took
                the first brother for his own... We see the second brother approach a cottage. 

                
 Meanwhile, the second brother journeyed to his home, where he
                took out the stone and turned it thrice in hand. To his delight, the girl he had
                once hoped to marry before her untimely death appeared before him. Yet soon she
                turned sad and cold, for she did not belong in the mortal world. Driven mad with
                hopeless longing, the second brother killed himself so as to join her. And so Death
                took the second brother... 

                
 As for the third brother, Death searched for many years but was
                never able to find him. Only when he had attained a great age did the youngest
                brother shed theCloak of Invisibility and give it to his son. He then greeted Death
                as an old friend and went with him gladly, departing this life as equals... 
 Well, there you are. Those are the Deathly Hallows. 
 Sorry... I still don’t really understand... 
 The Elder Wand... 
 The Resurrection Stone... 
 The Cloak of Invisibility. Together... they make the
                Deathly Hallows. Together... they make one master of Death. 
 Mr. Lovegood, does the Peverell family have anything to do with the
                Deathly Hallows? 
 That was the name on the grave with
                the mark on it in Godric’s Hollow. Ignotus Peverell. 
 Ignotus and his brothers Cadmus and Antioch are thought
                to be the original owners of the Hallows and therefore the inspiration for the
                story. 
 Ah, but your tea’s grown cold. Excuse me, I'll be right
                back. 

                
 Let’s get out of here once he’s back. I’m not
                touching this stuff, hot or cold. 

                
 Which one would you choose if you could? Of the
                Deathly Hallows? 
 It’s obvious, isn’t it? 
 The
                Wand. 
 The Cloak. The Stone. 
 They glance at each other, amused. 
 You’re supposed to say the Cloak, but who wants to spend all day being
                invisible. Dead boring if you ask me. But an unbeatable wand! 
 Its owner grew drunk with power and was murdered. 
 Yeah, but imagine what a short wicked life you’d lead. 

                
 Why the Stone, Harry? 
 Well, you could bring people back, couldn’t you? Mad-Eye. Dumbledore.
                Sirius. Anybody. 

                
 But according to the story they don’t want to come back. It’s
                all rubbish anyway. There’s no such thing as the Deathly Hallows. 
 But I have one. The InvisibilityCloak my father left me. 
 There have always been Cloaks -- 
 Not like Harry’s. I’ve seen a fair few. Dad used to bring home the ones
                the Ministry confiscated from petty thieves and the like. They always got holes or
                tears. Harry’s is different. It’s perfect. 
 And I think I’ve actually held theResurrection Stone in my hands, that
                night in Dumbledore’s office when he showed me the ring he’d destroyed, the Horcrux.
                It had a symbol on it. Now I think it was the mark of the Hallows. 
 Mr. Lovegood. Thank you, sir -- 
 You forgot the water. 
 The water? 
 For the tea. 
 Did, didn’t I? How silly of me. 
 No matter, sir. We really ought to be go- 
 No, you mustn’t - 
 Sir? 
 You’re my only hope. They were angry, you see, about
                what I’d been writing, so they took her. They took my Luna... 
 But it’s really you they want... 
 Who took her, sir? 
 Him. Surely you call him You-Know-Who. But his real name
                of course is... Voldemort. 
 Nooooooooo! 
 Stop! I’ve got him --
 Ron! Harry! Take my hand! 
 That treacherous old bleeder! Is there no one we can trust! 

                
 They’ve kidnapped Luna because he supported me. He was just
                desperate. 
 I’ll do the enchantments. 
 A wand BLOOMS above, illuminates the face of Scabior. Hermione’s
                red scarf, now faded and filthy, dangles from his neck. He presses it to his grimy
                nose, inhales andGRINS. 
 Hello, beautiful. 
 Ah, Tom, I thought you would come one day. But surely you must
                knowI no longer have what you seek... 
 If not you, then who? 
 You’re so innocent, Tom. Like a schoolboy. There’s so much you
                don’t understand... 
 Tell me, Grindelwald. Tell me where to find it! Tell me who
                possesses it! The name, Grindelwald! The name! 
 Can’t you guess, Tom? It lies with him, of course. Buried within
                the earth. It is he who possesses it, even in death. Your old friend and
                mine...Dumbledore. 
 They exist. The Hallows. 
 But he only wants the one, the last one. That’s what he’s been looking
                for. 
 What’re you saying? 
 He knows where it is, You-Know- Who. He’ll have it by the end of the
                night. He’s found the Elder Wand. 
 Don’t touch her! 
 Stop it! 
 Your boyfriend’ll get worse than that if he doesn’t behave, lovely.
                    
 What happened to you, ugly? 
 What’s your name? 
 Dudley. Vernon Dudley. 
 Check the list. And you, ginger? 
 Stan Shunpike. 
 Like ‘ell you are. We know skinnyStan. Try again. 
 Weasley... 
 Barney Weasley. 
 Weasley, eh? Wouldn’t be related to that blood traitor Arthur
                Weasley, would you? 
 Piss off! Arthur Weasley’s ten times the wizard you are! 
 Worth ten times you if I can find him. Wasn’t you that tipped him
                off, was it? 
 How ‘bout you, lovely? What do they call you...? 
 Penelope Clearwater. Half-blood. 
 You smell like vanilla, Penelope. I think you’re going to be my
                favorite. 
 There’s no Vernon Dudley on ‘ere. 
 Hear that, ugly? The list says you’re lying. How come you
                don’t want us to know who you are? Hm? 
 The list is wrong. I told you who I am --
 Change of plans, boys. We won’t be taking this lot to the Ministry.
            
 What did you put on me? 
 A Stinging Jinx. 
 How long will it last? 
 Not long. 
 Show me.
 Narcissa! 
 Cissy! You mustn’t do this. He can’t be trusted. 
 The Dark Lord trusts him. 
 The Dark Lord is mistaken. Narcissa turns, shocked. Bellatrix
                looks shocked herself, rain running down her cheeks. 
 Or so I believe. 
 Well, who can one trust these days? 
 He lives in this Muggle dunghill? Wormtail glowers over his
                shoulder at her. They pass into... 
 Run along, Wormtail. 
 I’ve nowhere else to turn, Severus. Snape hands her a goblet,
                extends one to Bellatrix. 
 You must be joking. Snape smiles faintly, brings the goblet to his
                own lips. 
 I know I ought not to be here. The Dark Lord himself has forbidden
                me to speak of this -SNAPE If the Dark Lord has forbidden it, you ought not to
                speak. 
 Put it down, Bella. We mustn’t touch what isn’t
                ours. Bellatrix, DARK CURIO in hand, glowers, sets it backdown. 
 As it so happens I’m aware of your situation, Narcissa. You? 
 The Dark Lord told you? 
 Your sister doubts me, Narcissa. Understandable. Over the years I have
                played my part well. So well I’ve deceived one of the greatest wizards of all time.
                    

            
 Dumbledore is a great wizard. Only a fool would question it. 
 I... I don’t doubt you, Severus. 
 You should feel honored, Cissy. As should Draco -NARCISSA He’s
                just a boy! 
 I can’t change the Dark Lord’s mind. But it might be possible for me
                to help Draco. To provide some... protection. Bellatrix eyes Snape keenly. 
 Do you mean it, Severus? 
 I can try. 
 Oh, Severus, please, if you would... (I would be forever in your
                debt.) Swear to it. 
 Snape’s eyes shift, meet Bellatrix’s challenging gaze. 
 Make the Unbreakable Vow. (as Snape looks away) You see. It’s just
                empty words. Oh he’ll try. He’ll give it his best effort. But when it matters most
                he’ll slither back into his hole. Bloody coward... 
 Take out your wand. 
 Will you, Severus Snape, watch over Draco Malfoy as he attempts to
                fulfill the Dark Lord’s wishes. 
 I will. 
 And will you, to the best of your ability, protect him from harm? 
 I will. 
 And should it prove necessary, if it seems Draco will fail... will
                you yourself carry out the deed that the Dark Lord has ordered Draco to perform?
                    
 I will. 
 Harry Potter. Who’s Harry Potter? 
 Oh. Um. No one. Bit of a tosser. 
 Funny that paper of yours. Couple nights ago, I could swear I saw
                one of the pictures move. 
 Really. 
 Thought I’d gone round the twist. 
 Hey. I was wondering... 
 Eleven. That’s when I get off. 
 You can
                tell me all about that tosser Harry Potter. 
 I once knew a Muggle girl from Liverpool with hair like spun
                silk. No light could resist it...
 You’ve been reckless this
                summer, Harry. 
 I like riding round on the trains. It takes my mind off... things.
                    
 Rather unpleasant to behold, isn’t it? The tale is thrilling if I
                do say so myself, but I’m afraid now is not the time to tell it. Take my arm.
                    
 Do as I say. 
 I just Apparated, didn’t I? 
 Indeed. And quite successfully I might add. Most people vomit
                their first time. 
 Can’t imagine why... 
 Welcome to the charming village of Budleigh Babberton, Harry. I
                assume right about now you’re wondering why I’ve brought you here, am I right? 

                
 After all these years, I just sort of roll with it,
                sir. 
 Wand out, Harry. 
 Lumos... 
 Horace! 
 Merlin’s Beard! 

                
 There’s no need to disfigure me, Albus! 
 I must say, you make a very convincing armchair, Horace. 
 It’s all in the upholstery. 
 I
                come by the stuffing naturally. What gave me away? 

                
 Dragon’s blood. 
 Yes, well, I couldn’t very well use wizard’s blood, could I? Oho!
                    
 Ah yes. Introductions. Harry, this is an old friend and colleague
                of mine, Horace Slughorn. Horace, this is, well, you know who this is. 
 Apparently there’s some thought he may be the Chosen One.
                    
 So why all the theatrics, Horace? You weren’t perhaps expecting
                someone else, were you? 

                
 S-someone else? I’m sure I don’t know what you mean. 
 Oh all right! The Death Eaters have been trying to recruit me for
                over a year. Do you know what that’s like? One can only say no to these people so
                many times before they... 
 Take matters into their own hands? 
 I never stay anywhere more than a week. The Muggles who own this
                place are in the Canary Islands. 
 Well, I think it should be put back in order for them, don’t you?
                Mind? 
 That was fun. May I use the loo? 
 Don’t think I don’t know why you’re here, Albus! The answer is
                still no! Absolutely, unequivocally no! 
 You look very like your father. Except for your eyes. You’ve got -- 
 My mother’s eyes, yeah. 

                
 Lily. Lovely Lily. She was exceedingly bright -- your
                mother. Even more impressive when one considers she was Muggle-born. 
 One of my best friends is Muggle- born. She’s the best in our year. 
 Oh, but you mustn’t think I’m prejudiced! No, no, no! Your mother
                was one of my absolute favorites! Look, there she is. Right up front. 
 All mine, each and every one. Ex- students, I mean. You recognize
                Barnubas Cuffe, of course, editor of the Daily Prophet. Always takes my owl should I
                want to register my opinion on the news of the day. And there’s Ambrosius Flume of
                Honeydukes. Sends a hamper of chocolate to the house each birthday. That is, when I
                had a house. And Gwenog Jones, captain of the Holyhead Harpies -- free tickets
                whenever I want them. Of course, I haven’t been to a match in some time... 
 Ah yes. Regulus Black. You no doubt know of his older brother
                Sirius. Died a few weeks ago. I taught the whole Black family except Sirius. Shame.
                Talented boy. I got Regulus when he came along, of course, but I’d have liked the
                set. 
 Mind if I take this? I do love knitting patterns. Slughorn
                blinks, looks away from Harry and finds Dumbledore standing there, clutching a
                MUGGLE MAGAZINE. Of course. leaving? 
 But you’re not 
 I think I know a lost cause when I see one. Regrettable. I would
                have considered it a personal triumph had you consented to return to Hogwarts,
                Horace. You are, like my friend Mr. Potter -- one of a kind. 
 All right! I’ll do it. But I’ll be wanting Professor Merrythought’s
                old office, not that water closet I had formerly. And I expect a raise! These are
                mad times we live in! Mad! 
 Indeed they are. 
 Sir, exactly what was that all -- 
 You are talented, famous and powerful -- everything Horace
                values. Professor Slughorn is going to try to collect you, Harry. You would be his
                crowning jewel. That is why he is returning to Hogwarts. And it is crucial he
                return... Harry looks intrigued by this last statement, but before he can pursue it,
                Dumbledore glances ruefully at the moon. 
 I fear I may have stolen a wondrous night from you, Harry. She
                was, truthfully, very pretty. The girl. 
 It’s alright, sir. I’ll go back tomorrow, make some excuse -- Harry
                stops. Dumbledore is shaking his head. 
 You’ll not be going back to Little Whinging tonight, Harry. 
 But, sir. What about Hedwig? there’s my trunk -- And 
 Both are waiting for you. 
 Sir? 
 Hedwig...? Mum! 
 What is it, Ginny? Is it your father? Has something happened at
                the Ministry? Has he been kidnapped? Is it the Death Eaters? 
 Exactly. How’d you guess? 

            
 I’m joking, Mum. 
 You’re worse than Fred and George. 
 Now you’re joking. I was only wondering when Harry got here. 
 Harry who? 
 Harry Dimpleton. Harry Potter, of course. 
 I think I’d know if Harry Potter was in my house, wouldn’t I? 
 Well his trunk’s in the kitchen. And his owl. 
 I seriously doubt that. 

            
 Harry? Did someone say Harry? 
 Me, nosy. Is he up there with you? 
 ‘Course not. Think I’d know if my best friend was in my room, wouldn’t
                I? 

            
 Was that an owl I heard? 
 Harry’s. Haven’t seen him, have you? Apparently, he’s wandering about
                the house. 
 Really? 
 Really. 
 Harry! 

            
 But why didn’t you tell us you were coming? 
 Didn’t know. 
 Dumbledore. 
 That man. But then, what would we do without him? Ron! 
 You’ve a bit of... 
 When’d you get here? 
 A few days ago. Though... for a bit, I wasn’t sure I was coming.
                    
 Mum sort of lost it last week. Said Ginny and I had no business going
                back to Hogwarts. That it’s too dangerous. 
 Oh come on... 
 She’s not alone. Even my parents-- and they’re Muggles -- know
                something bad is happening. 
 Anyway, Dad stepped in, told her she was being barmy. Took a day or two,
                but she came round. 
 But we’re talking about Hogwarts. Dumbledore. What could be safer?
                    

            
 There’s been a lot of chatter lately. That he’s gotten... old. 
 Rubbish. He’s only -- what? 
 A hundred and fifty. Give or take a few years. 

            
 Step up! Step up! 
 We’ve got Fainting Fancy... 
 Nosebleed Nougats... 
 And just in time for school... 
 Puking Pastilles! 
 Into the cauldron, handsome. 

            
 What’d you think, Harry? 
 Amazing. 

                
 Pocket that and you’ll pay in more than Galleons,
                my friend. 
 We’ve got eyes in the back of our heads. 

            
 Bloody urchins. 
 Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder? 
 A real money spinner that. 
 Handy if you need to make a quick escape. Hello, ladies! 

            
 Yes, they do really work. 
 Then again, the way we hear it, sis, you’re doing just fine on your
                own. 
 Meaning? 
 Are you not currently dating Dean Thomas? 

            
 None of your business. 
 These are adorable. 
 Aren’t they now. Pygmy Puffs. Can’t breed them fast enough. 

            
 How much for this? 
 Five Galleons. 
 How much for me? 
 Five Galleons. 
 But I’m your brother! 
 Ten Galleons. 
 C’mon. Let’s go. 
 Hi, Ron. 
 Hi. 
 How is it Fred and George are doing it? Half the alley’s closed
                down. 
 Fred reckons people need a laughthese days. 
 Reckon he’s right... Harry eyes the poster of Bellatrix, her mocking
                half- smile. Oh no. Look. 
 Harry and Ron follow her gaze to the wreck that isOllivander’s Wand
                Shop. 
 But everyone got their wands fromOllivander. Young. Old... Good.
                Bad. 
 Speaking of which... Across the avenue, DRACO MALFOY and Narcissa
                pause, glance around, then slip quickly down an alley. 
 Is it just me? Or do Draco and mummy look like two people who don’t want
                to be followed? 
 What’re they playing at? 
 Dunno. Let’s get closer. 
 (a nod; stopping) Hey. Where’s Hermione? 
 Harry, where is she? 
 I don’t know. I’m turned around. 
 Bloody hell. 
 Sorry. 
 What just happened? 
 I don’t know. 
 Quibbler...? Quibbler...? 
 There’s an article on Wrackspurts this month. Quibbler...? 
 He’s lovely. They’ve been known to sing on Boxing Day, you know.
                Quibbler? 
 Please. What’s a Wrackspurt? 
 They’re invisible creatures that float in through your ears and make
                your brain go fuzzy. 
 Quibbler? Quibbler? 
 Don’t you see, it was a ceremony. An initiation. 
 Stop, Harry, I know where you’re going with this -- 
 It’s happened. He’s one of them. 
 One of what? 
 Harry is under the impression that Draco Malfoy is now a Death
                Eater. 
 You’re barking. What would You-Know- Who want with a sod like Malfoy? 
 So what’s he doing in Borgin and Burke’s? Browsing for furniture? 
 It’s a creepy shop. bloke. He’s a creepy 
 Look. His father’s a Death Eater. It only makes sense. Besides,
                Hermione saw it. With her own eyes. 
 I told you. I don’t know what I saw. 
 I need some air. 
 What just happened? Blaise? 

                
 Don’t know. 
 Relax, boys. The lights went out is all. Come, Draco. We’ll be at
                Hogwarts before you know it. She pats the seat. Draco eyes the bag, slings it back
                onto the luggage rack and plops down. Pansy strokes his hair. 
 Hogwarts. What a pathetic excuse for a school. I think I’d pitch
                myself off the Astronomy Tower ifI thought I had to continue on for another two
                years. Pansy, gently twisting one of Draco’s locks, stops. 
 What’s that supposed to mean? 
 Let’s just say I don’t think you’ll be seeing me wasting my time in
                Charms Class next year. Confused, Pansy glances at Blaise, who snorts derisively. 
 Amused, Blaise? We’ll see just who’s laughing in the end. Blaise
                shakes his head, smiling as he looks out the window at the darkness. Just then the
                small bag in the upper rack shifts. Malfoy’s eyes play over it. 
 Where’s Harry? 
 Probably on the platform. C’mon. 
 You two go on. I want to check something. 
 Didn’t mummy ever tell you it’s bad manners to eavesdrop, Potter?
                Petrificus Totalus! 

            
 Oh, right, she was dead before you could wipe the drool off your
                chin. 

            
 Enjoy the ride back to London. 
 Hello, Harry. 
 Luna. How’d you...? 
 Wrackspurts. Your head’s full of them. 
 Sorry I made you miss the carriages, Luna. 
 It’s alright. I enjoyed our walk. It was like being with a friend. 
 I am your friend, Luna. 
 That’s nice. 
 About time! I’ve been looking all over for you two. Names. 
 Professor Flitwick, you’ve known me for five years. 
 No exceptions, Potter. 
 Who are those people? 
 Aurors. For security. 
 It’s a not a cane, you cretin. It’s a walking
                stick. 
 And what exactly would you be wanting with a walking stick? 
 It was his father’s. 
 Is my father’s. He’s not dead. 
 It’s alright, Mr. Filch. I can vouch for Mr. Malfoy. 
 Nice face, Potter. 
 Would you like me to fix it? Personally I think you look a bit more
                devil-may-care this way. But it’s up to you. 
 Have you ever fixed one? A nose. 
 No. But I’ve done several toes and how different are they really?
                    
 What the hell. Give it a go. 
 Episkey. 
 Well? How do I look? 
 Exceptionally ordinary. 
 Brilliant. 
 Don’ you worry. He’ll be ‘long soon ‘nuff -- 

                
 Will. You. Stop. Eating! Your best friend is missing! 
 Oi! Turn around, you lunatic. 
 He’s covered in blood again. Why is it he’s always covered in blood? 
 Looks like his own this time. 

                
 Where’ve you been, Harry? And what happened to your
                face? 
 Later. What’ve I missed? 
 (shrugging; still
 Thanks... 
 What’s happened to his hand? 
 The very best of evenings to you! First off, please join me in
                welcoming the newest member of our staff, Horace Slughorn. 
 Professor Slughorn, I’m happy to say, has agreed to resume his
                old post of Potions master. Meanwhile the post of Defense Against theDark Arts will
                be assumed byProfessor Snape. 
 Now, as you know, each and everyone of you was searched upon your
                arrival tonight. You have a right to know why. 
 Once there was
                a young man who, like you, sat in this very Hall. Walked this castle’s corridors.
                Slept beneath its roof. He seemed, to all the world, a student like any other. His
                name? Tom Riddle. 
 Today, of course, the world knows him by another name. Which is
                why, as I stand looking out upon you all tonight, I am reminded of a sobering fact.
                Each day, every hour, this very minute perhaps, dark forces attempt to penetrate
                this castle. But in the end, their greatest weapon remains... you. 
 Just something to keep in mind. Now, off to bed. Pip pip! 

                
 That was cheerful. 
 History of Magic is up, ladies, not down. Mr. Davies -- that’s
                the girl’s toilet... 

            
 Potter! 

            
 This can’t be good. 
 Enjoying ourself, are we? 
 Well, you see, I’ve got an open period this morning, Professor - 
 So I noticed. I would think you’d want to fill it with Potions.
                Or is it no longer your ambition to become an Auror? 
 It is. Or was. But I was told I had to get an Outstanding in my O.W.L.
                - 
 And so you did when Professor Snape was teaching Potions.
                However, Professor Slughorn is perfectly happy to accept N.E.W.T. students with
                ‘Exceeds Expectations.’ 
 Really? Well... brilliant. I’ll head there straight away. 
 Good. And take Weasley with you. He looks far too happy over
                there. 
 But I don’t want to take Potions! 
 Harry m’boy! I was beginning to worry! And I see we’ve brought
                someone with us... 
 Ron Weasley, sir. But I’m dead awful at Potions, a menace actually, so I
                probably should just be going - 
 Nonsense, we’ll sort you out. Any friend of Harry’s is a friend of
                mine. Right then, books out - 
 Um, sorry, sir, but I haven’t got my book yet -- nor’s Ron. You see
                    --

            
 Not to worry. You can get what you need from the cupboard. 
 Now, as I was saying, I’ve prepared a few concoctions this morning.
                Any ideas what these might be? Yes, Miss...? 
 Granger, sir. That one there is Veritaserum. And that would be
                Polyjuice Potion. And that... 
 ... is Amortentia! The most powerful love potion in the world. It’s
                rumored to smell differently to each person, according to what attracts them. For
                example, I smell freshly mown grass and new parchment and spearmint toothpaste
                    -
 One of my best friends is Muggle- born. She’s the best in our
                year... 
 Now Amortentia doesn’t create actual love, of course. That’s
                impossible. But it does cause a powerful infatuation or obsession. For that reason,
                it is probably the most dangerous potion in this room. 
 Sir, you haven’t told us what’s in that one. 
 Ah yes... 
 What you see before you, ladies and gentlemen, is a curious little
                potion known as Felix Felicis. But it is more commonly referred to as - 
 Liquid luck. 
 Yes, Miss Granger. Desperately tricky to make. Disastrous should
                you get it wrong. But brewed correctly, as this has been, it has remarkable powers.
                One sip and you will find that all your endeavors succeed... at least until the
                effects wear off. 
 But then why don’t people drink it all the time? 
 Because taken in excess it causes giddiness, recklessness and
                dangerous overconfidence. 
 Have you ever taken it, sir? 
 Twice. Once when I was twenty- four. Once when I was fifty- seven.
                Two tablespoons taken at breakfast. Two perfect days... 
 So. This is what I offer each of you today. One tiny vial of liquid
                luck... to the student who, in the hour that remains, manages to brew an acceptable
                Draught ofLiving Death, the recipe for which can be found on page ten of your
                textbook. 
 You should know that in all the years of my previous tenure at
                Hogwarts, not once did a student brew a potion of sufficient quality to claim this
                prize. In any event -- good luck. 
 How did you do that? 
 Crush it. Don’t cut it. 
 No. The instructions specifically say to cut. 
 No. Really - 
 Sh! 
 Merlin’s Beard! But it’s perfect. So perfect I daresay one sip
                would kill us all! Your mother was a dab hand at potions, but this...My, my, what
                can’t you do, m’boy? Perhaps you will save us all in the end... 
 Here you are then, as promised. One bottle of Felix Felicis. Use it
                well. 
 Good evening, Harry. You got my message, I see. Come, come. Sit.
                    
 So. How are you? 
 Fine, sir. 
 Enjoying your classes? Professor Slughorn, for one, is most
                impressed with you. 
 I think he overestimates my abilities, sir. 
 Do you? 
 Definitely. 
 And what of your activities outside the classroom? Do they bring
                you satisfaction? 
 Sir? 
 I notice you spend a great deal of time with Miss Granger. One
                can’t help but wonder if - 
 No! I mean... she’s brilliant. And we’re friends. But... no. 
 Forgive me, Harry, I... 
 ... I was merely curious. 
 In any event, I’m
                sure you’re wondering why I’ve summoned you here tonight. The answer lies here.
                    
 What you see before you are memories. In this case pertaining to
                one individual: Voldemort. Or as he was known then... Tom Riddle. 
 This vial contains a most particular memory -- of the day I first
                met him. I’d like you to see it. If you would... 
 I must confess to a bit of confusion upon receiving your letter,
                Mr. Dumbledore. In all the years Tom’s been here, he’s never once had a family
                visitor. Frankly, I was stunned to find that someone knew of his existence. 
 I am not family. But his name has been known to me since birth. I
                see... 
 But she doesn’t really. She stops, frowns. 
 I think I should tell you. He’s a funny boy -- Tom. Odd. There have
                been incidents with the other children. Nasty things. 
 Perhaps you could give me an example. 
 You’ve got a visitor, Tom. 
 How do you do, Tom. 
 Well, I’ll leave you two to yourselves. 
 Don’t. 
 As you wish. 
 You’re the doctor, aren’t you? 
 No. I am a Professor. 
 I don’t believe you. I hear Mrs. Cole talking, her and the rest of
                the staff. They want me looked at. They think I’m different. 
 Perhaps they’re right. 
 I’m not mad. 
 Hogwarts is not a place for mad people. 
 It’s a school. A school of... magic. 
 You can do things, can’t you, Tom? Things the other children
                can’t. 
 Yes. 
 Tell me some of the things you cando, Tom. 

                
 I can make things move -- without touching them.
                I can make animals do what I want without training them. I can make bad things
                happen to people who are mean to me. I can make them hurt... if I want. 
 Who are you? 
 I’m like you, Tom. Different. 
 Prove it. 
 I think there is something trying to get out of your wardrobe,
                Tom. Open it. Open. It. 
 Take it out. 
 Is there anything in that box you ought not to have? 
 Why did you want these things, Tom? 

                
 I like having things that belonged to other people. It
                makes me feel ... close to them. 
 Thievery is not tolerated at Hogwarts. At Hogwarts, you will be
                taught not only how to use magic, but to control it. Understood? 
 I’ll be going now, Tom. Leave your window open tonight. An owl will
                bring you a message. Read it carefully. 
 I can speak to snakes too. 
 They find me. Whisper things. Is that normal. For someone like me? 
 It is unusual. But not unheard of. 

            
 Did you know, sir? Then? 
 Did I know that I had just met the most dangerous Dark Wizard of
                all time? No. Had I... 
 Over time, while here at Hogwarts, Tom Riddle grew close to one
                particular teacher. Can you guess which teacher that might be? 
 You didn’t bring ProfessorSlughorn back simply to teachPotions, did
                you, sir? 
 No. I did not. You see, Professor Slughorn possesses something I
                desire very dearly. And he will not part with it easily... 
 I’d rather not divulge any more just yet, Harry. But I
                promise. In time you will know everything. 
 You said Professor Slughorn would try to collect me. 
 I did. 
 Do you want me to let him? 

            
 Yes. 
 All right! Queue up! Excuse me... 
 SHUT IT! 
 Thanks. All right. This morning I’ll be putting you all through a few
                drills to assess your strengths. But know this: Just because you made the team last
                year does not guarantee you a spot this year. Is that clear? 
 No hard feelings, Weasley, alright? 
 Hard feelings? 
 I’ll be going out for Keeper as well. Nothing personal. 
 Really? Strapping guy like you, you’ve got a Beater’s build, don’t you
                think? Keeper needs to be agile, quick --
 I like my chances. Say... think you could introduce me to your friend
                Granger? Wouldn’t mind getting on a first name basis, know what I mean? 
 All right. Cormac. Ron. It’s down to you two for Keeper. We’ll decide
                it with a shootout. Demelza, you’ll bring the Quaffle up against Cormac. Ginny,
                you’ll take on Ron. 
 Hang on. She’s his sister. How do I know she won’t toss him a
                floater? 
 Piss off, Cormac. How ‘bout I toss you a floater? 
 Quiet! I’m Captain. We do it my way. Now line up. On three. One.
                Two... Three! 

                
 C’mon, Ron... 
 Isn’t he brilliant? 
 Have to admit, thought I was going to miss that last one. Hope Cormac’s
                not taking it too hard. 

            
 Has a bit of a thing for you, Hermione. Cormac. 
 He’s vile. 

            
 Ever heard of this spell? 

            
 No I have not. And if you had a shred of self-respect you would
                turn that book in. 
 Not bloody likely. He’s top of the class. Even better than you,
                Hermione. Slughorn thinks he’s a genius. 

            
 What? 
 I’d like to know just whose book that was. Let’s take a look, shall
                we? 

                
 No. 

                
 Why not? 
 It’s... old. The binding is fragile. 
 The binding is fragile? 

            
 Who’s the Half-Blood Prince? 
 The who? 
 That’s what it says. Right here. ‘This Book is the Property of
                theHalf-Blood Prince.’ 

            
 For weeks you carry around this book, practically sleep with it...
                and you have no desire to find out who The Half-Blood Prince is? 
 I didn’t say I wasn’t curious. And, by the way, I don’t sleep with it. 

                
 Yeah. Right. 

                Well, it’s true. I like a nice chat before I go to bed. Now you’re always reading
                that bloody book. It’s like being with Hermione. This time it’s Hermione’s turn to
                glare. 
 Well, I was curious. So I went to 
 -The library. 
 And? 
 And... nothing. There’s no reference to the Half-Blood Prince
                anywhere. 
 Good. That settles it then. 

            
 Hey, you three! 

            
 What’ve you got there, Hagrid? 
 Stinksap. Burn the whiskers right off yer chin. Trees ‘ere are
                drippin’ with it. 
 Stinksap? You’re not sick, are you? 
 It’s not fer me. It’s fer Aragog. Yeh remember Aragog, don’ yeh? 
 Spider? About six feet tall? Ten feet wide? 
 Tha’s the one. He’s taken ill. I’m hopin’ ter nurse ‘im back. Keep
                yer fingers crossed. 

            
 Barking. Does he not remember that raving arachnid tried to eat us?
                What? 

            
 The Aurors. I know they’re here to protect us, but... somehow I
                don’t feel any safer. 

            
 Filius! I was hoping to find you at the Three Broomsticks. 
 Emergency choir practice, I’m afraid, Horace. 

            
 Who’s up for a Butterbeer? 
 No. Over here. 
 No, no. Sit next to me. 
 O-kay. 
 What’ll we have? 
 Three Butterbeers. Splash of ginger in mine, please. 
 Aw, bloody hell... 
 Oh, honestly, Ronald. They’re just holding hands... 
 And snogging. 
 I’d like to leave. 
 Leave? You can’t be serious. 
 That happens to be my sister. 
 So? What if she looked over here and saw you snogging me? Would you
                expect her to get up and leave? 
 Harry, m’boy! 
 Hello, sir. Wonderful to see you. 
 So what brings you here, sir? 
 Oh, the Three Broomsticks and I go way back. Longer than I’d care
                to admit. In fact, I remember when it was simply One Broomstick! 
 Oops! All hands on deck, Granger! 
 Listen, m’boy. In the old days, I used to throw together the
                occasional supper and invite a select student or two. Would you be game? 
 I’d consider it an honor, sir. 
 You’d be welcome too, Granger. 
 Be delighted, sir. 
 Brilliant. Look for my owl. (exiting, to Ron) Good to see you,
                Wallenby. 
 What’re you playing at? 
 Dumbledore asked me to... get to know him. 
 Get to know him? 
 Dunno. But it must be important. Otherwise Dumbledore wouldn’t ask.
                    
 Um... You’ve got a little... 
 Bit worried about her. Did you hear that rubbish she was talking back in
                the pub? Her and me snogging. Ha. As if... 
 Katie. You don’t know what it could be! 

            
 What’s up? 

            
 I warned her! I warned her not to touch it! 
 Harry, she’s swallowing her tongue -- 
 I’ll get someone -- 
 There’s no time! 

            
 Get back! All o’ yeh! 

            
 Now, now. Now, now... 

            
 Don’ go touchin’ tha’ but by the wrappin’s. Unnerstan’? 

            
 You’re sure Katie did not have this in her possession when she
                entered the Three Broomsticks, Leanne? 
 It’s like I said. She went to the loo and when she came back she had
                the package. She said it was important she deliver it. 
 Did she say to whom? 
 All right, Leanne. You may go. 
 Why
                is it always you three? Hm? When something happens? 
 Believe me, Professor, I’ve been asking myself the same question for six
                years. 
 Severus. 
 Is this it? 
 What do you think? 
 I think Miss Bell is lucky to be alive. 
 She was cursed, wasn’t she? I know Katie. Off the Quidditch pitch she
                wouldn’t hurt a fly. If she was bringing that to someone, she wasn’t doing it
                knowingly. 
 Yes. She was cursed. 
 It was Malfoy. 
 That’s a very serious accusation, Potter. 
 Indeed. Your evidence? 
 I... just... know. 
 You... just... know. Once again you astonish with your gifts, Potter,
                gifts mere mortals could only dream of possessing. How grand it must be to be the
                Chosen One. 
 I suggest you return to your dormitory. All of you. 
 What do you suppose Dean sees in her? Ginny. 
 What does she see in him? Dean? 
 He’s brilliant. 
 You called him a slick git not five hours ago. 
 Yeah, well, he was running his hands all over my sister, wasn’t he?
                Something snaps. You’ve got to hate him. You know, on principle. 

                
 I suppose. 
 So what is it? He sees in her? 
 I don’t know. She’s smart. Funny. Attractive... Attractive? 
 You know. 
 She’s... got nice skin. 
 Skin? You’re saying Dean’s dating my sister because of her skin? 
 Well, no. I mean... I’m just saying it could be a contributing factor.
                    
 Hermione’s got nice skin. Wouldn’t you say? As skin goes, I mean. 
 I’ve never really thought about it. But I suppose, yeah. Very nice.
                    
 I think I’ll be going to sleep now. 
 Right. 

                
 A toast! 
 To Hogwarts’ best and brightest! 
 Here, here! 
 Which one do I use for the soup? 
 So tell me, Cormac. See much of your Uncle Tiberius these days? 
 Yes, sir. In fact, I’m meant to go hunting with him and theMinister
                for Magic over holiday. 
 Well, be sure to give them both my best. What about your uncle,
                Belby? Working on anything new? 
 For those of you who
                don’t know, Marcus’ uncle invented the Wolfsbane Potion. 
 Dunno. He and me dad don’t get on. Probably because Dad thinks
                potions are rubbish. Says the only potion worth having is a stiff one at the end of
                the - 

            
 And you, Miss Granger? What is it your family does in the Muggle
                world? 
 My parents are dentists. They tend to people’s teeth. 
 Fascinating. And is that considered a dangerous profession? 
 No. Though, a boy named Robbie Fenwick did bite my father once.
                Needed ten stitches. 
 Miss Weasley! Come in, come in. 
 Sorry, I’m not ordinarily late --
 No matter. You’ll be just in time for dessert. That is -- if Belby
                leaves you any. 
 Look at her eyes. They’ve been fighting again. Her and Dean.
                    
 What? 
 Nothing. 

            
 Thank you, one and all, for a most stimulating evening. We’ll have
                to do it again. 
 Oh. Potter. 
 Sorry, sir, I was just admiring your hourglass. 
 Ah, yes. A most intriguing object. The sands run in accordance to
                the quality of the conversation. When it is stimulating, the sands run slow. When it
                is not... 
 I think I’ll be going. 
 Nonsense. You have nothing to fear, m’boy. As for some of your
                classmates, well, let’s just say, they’re unlikely to make the shelf. 
 The shelf, sir? 
 Anyone who aspires to be anyone hopes to end up here. Then again...
                you are already someone aren’t you, Harry? 
 I don’t really know how to answer that, sir. 
 Your mother was modest too. Your father not so much. As you can
                see, he did not make the shelf. 
 Did Voldemort ever make the shelf, sir? 
 You knew him, didn’t you, sir? Tom Riddle. You were his teacher. 
 Mr. Riddle had many teachers while here at Hogwarts. 
 What was he like? 
 I’m sorry, sir. Forgive me. He killed my parents, you see... 
 Of course. It’s only natural that you should want to know more. I’m
                afraid I must disappoint you, Harry. When I first met young Mr. Riddle, he was
                simply a quiet, albeit brilliant, boy committed to becoming a first-rate wizard. Not
                unlike the others I’ve known. In fact, not unlike... you. If the monster existed, it
                was buried deep within. 
 Good luck, eh, Ron? Ron nods shortly, then Seamus comes up on his
                side, 

            
 Counting on you, Ron. I’ve two Galleons on Gryffindor. 
 So. How was it? 
 How was what? 

                
 Your dinner party. 
 Dead boring. Though I think Harry enjoyed dessert. 
 Ol’ Sluggy’s having a Christmas do, you know. And we’re meant to
                bring someone... 
 I expect you’ll be going with McLaggen. Isn’t he a member of the Slug
                Club? 
 Actually, I was going to ask you. 
 Really? 
 Really. But seeing as you have such a distaste for the idea - 

                
 Good luck today, Ron! I know you’ll be brilliant!
                    

            
 I’m resigning. After today’s match. McLaggen can have my spot.
                    

            
 Have it your way. Juice? 
 Sure... 

            
 Hello, everyone. You look dreadful, Ron. 

            
 Is that why you just put something in his cup. Is it a tonic?
                    

            
 Don’t drink that, Ron! 

            
 You could be expelled for that. 
 Dunno what you’re talking about. 

            
 C’mon, Harry. We’ve got a game to win. 
 What’s gotten into him? 
 Ginny! Let’s go! 
 Weasley! Weasley! Weasley! 

            
 Ron seems to be enjoying himself. 
 Yep. Apparently it’s his lucky day. 
 You shouldn’t have done it, Harry. 
 Yeah. I suppose I could’ve just used, I dunno... a Confundus charm? 

                
 That was different. It was tryouts. This was an actual match
                    -
 You didn’t put it in? 
 Ron only
                thought you did? 
 Charms spell. Just practicing. 
 Ah. Well... they’re really good. 

                
 How does it feel, Harry? When you see Dean with
                Ginny? 
 I know, Harry. You’re my best friend. I see how
                you look at her. 
 Oops. I think this room’s taken. 
 What’s with the birds? 
 Oppugno! 
 It feels like this. 
 Look, I can’t help it if she’s got her knickers in a twist. What Lav and
                I have -- well, let’s just say there was no stopping it. It’s chemical. Will it
                last? Who knows? Point is, I’m a free agent. 
 He’s at perfect liberty to kiss whomever he likes. I really
                couldn’t care less. Was I under the impression that he and I would be attending
                Slughorn’s Christmas party together? Yes. Of course, now, given the circumstances,
                I’ve had to make other arrangements. 
 Have you? 
 Yes. Why? 
 I just thought, you know, since neither one of us can take who we’d
                really like... maybe we’d go together. As friends. 

                
 Why didn’t I think of that? 
 So who are you taking? 

                
 Um... it’s a surprise. Besides, it’s you we need to worry
                about. And you can’t pick just anyone. See that girl over there. That’s Romilda
                Vane. Rumor has it she’s trying to slip you a love potion. 
 Really...? 

            

                
 Hey! She’s only interested in you because she
                thinks you’re theChosen One. You know that, right? 
 But I am the Chosen One. 

            
 Okay. Kidding. I’ll just ask someone I like. Someone cool. 
 I’ve never been to this part of the castle. At least not while awake. I
                sleepwalk, you see. It’s why I wear shoes to bed. 

            
 Thank you, Adrian! 
 One of mine.
                Class of ‘78. I had hoped for more out of him, but at least the pictures are in
                focus. 
 Oh my! Excuse me, Harry. I must greet the new
                Minister of Magical Transportation. Class of ‘67. 

                Mingle, m’boy! Mingle! We’re all friends here. And we run the world. 

            
 Drink? 
 Neville...? 
 I didn’t make the cut for the Slug Club. It’s okay. He’s got Belby
                handing out towels in the loo. 
 Lovegood, did you say? I once encountered a seriously
                unbalanced man by that name at a book signing. Claimed to run a magazine... 
 What’re you doing? 
 And what’s happened to you? 
 Hm? Oh, I’ve just escaped -- I mean, left Cormac. Under the
                mistletoe. 
 Cormac! That’s who you invited! 
 I thought it would annoy Ron most. But he’s a menace. He’s got more
                tentacles than a Snarfalump plant. 
 Dragon tartar? 
 No thank you. 
 Just as well. They give one horribly bad breath. 

                
 On second thought -- maybe it’ll keep Cormac at
                bay. Oh no, here he comes! 
 I think she went to powder her nose. 
 Slippery little minx, your friend. Likes to work her mouth too,
                doesn’t she? Yak yak yak. What is this I’m eating, by the way? 
 Dragon balls. 
 What’s going on back here? 
 You’ve just bought yourself a month’s detention, McLaggen. 
 Not so quick, Potter. 
 I think I should rejoin the party, sir. My date... 
 ... can surely survive your absence for another minute or two.
                Besides, I only wish to convey a message. 
 A message...? 
 From Professor Dumbledore. He asked that I give you his best and that
                he hopes you enjoy your holiday. You see, he’s traveling and won’t return until term
                resumes. 
 Traveling? Where? 
 Take your hands off me, you filthy squib! 
 Professor Slughorn, sir! I’ve just discovered this boy lurking in an
                upstairs corridor. He claims to have been invited to your party. 
 Okay, okay, I was gate-crashing. Happy? 
 I’ll escort him out. 
 Certainly... Professor. 

                
 Maybe I did hex that Bell girl. Maybe I didn’t. What’s it to
                you? 
 I swore to protect you. I made the Unbreakable Vow - 
 I don’t need protection. I was chosen for this! Out of all others.
                Me! And I won’t fail him. 
 You’re afraid, Draco. You attempt to conceal it, but it’s obvious. Let
                me assist you - 
 No! I was chosen. This is my moment! 

            
 Unbreakable Vow. You’re sure that’s what Snape said. 
 Positive. Why? 
 It’s just, well, you can’t break an Unbreakable Vow. 
 I’d worked that much out for myself, funnily enough. 
 No, you don’t understand -- Oh, bloody hell... 
 Lovely. 
 All she wants to do is snog me. My lips are getting chapped. Look. 
 I’ll take your word for it. 
 So what happens? If you break anUnbreakable Vow? 
 You die. 
 Eat up, eat up, everyone! There’s more to come! 
 Draco’s plotting something, I know it, something to do withVoldemort.
                He’s been given a task or a mission -- and Snape was offering to help. 
 Voldemort has chosen Draco Malfoy for a mission? 
 I know it sounds mad - 
 Has it occurred to you, Harry, that Snape was simply pretending to
                offer Draco help so that he could find out what he’s up to? 
 That’s not what it sounded like. 
 Perhaps Harry’s right, Remus. To make an Unbreakable Vow, after all - 
 It comes down to whether or not you trust Dumbledore’s judgement. He
                trusts Snape. Therefore, I do. 
 But Dumbledore can make mistakes. He’s said it himself - 
 You’re blinded by hatred. 
 I’m not - 

                
 You are! People are disappearing, Harry. Daily. We can only
                put our trust in a handful of people. If we start fighting amongst ourselves, we’re
                doomed. 
 Open up, you. 
 Don’t trust me? 
 It’s good. 
 ‘Course ‘tis. Made them myself. 
 You’ll have to forgive Remus. It takes its toll -- his condition. 

                
 Are you alright, Mr. Weasley? 
 We’re being followed, all of us. Molly doesn’t leave the house
                most days. It’s not been easy. 

                
 Did you get my owl? 
 Yes, but I thought it best if I replied in person. If
                Dumbledore’s traveling, it’s news to the Ministry. But perhaps that’s the way
                Dumbledore wants it. As for Draco Malfoy -- I know a bit more. 
 Go on. 
 I sent an agent to Borgin & Burkes. From what you describe, I
                think what you and Ron saw at the end of the summer -- the object that Draco seemed
                so interested in -- was a Vanishing Cabinet. 
 A Vanishing Cabinet? 
 They were all the rage when Voldemort first rose to power. You
                can imagine the appeal. Should the Death Eaters come calling, one needed only slip
                inside and disappear for an hour or two. But they’re tricky contraptions. Require a
                tremendous amount of looking after. Eventually they fell out of favor. 
 What happened to it? The one at Borgin & Burkes? 
 Nothing. It’s still there. 
 Harry. You know, I went through all this before -- the last time
                around. Times like these -- dark times -- do funny things to people. It can bring
                them together and it can tear them apart. Things... speed up. It’s what happens when
                you don’t know if today will be your last. 
 It was delicious, Molly. Really. 
 You’re sure you won’t stay? 
 No, we should go. 
 The first night of
                the cycle is always the worst - 

                
 Remus...? 
 
 Everyone gone to bed? 
 Soon. 
 I don’t sleep these days. So I wash my hair. Silly, right?
                    

            
 Happy Christmas, Harry. 
 CONTRACT. His PUPILS Sweetheart... 
 There’s someone out there. I can smell him. There’s more than one
                    

            
 Harry turns, his BREATH FOGGING the WINDOWPANE as, far below, FLAMES
                SNAKE out of the reeds and SLITHER toward the house. Bellatrix emerges, peering up
                through the darkness toward Harry’s SILHOUETTE, a mad grin on her face. As she
                SHRIEKS EERILY, his eyes flash with hatred. 
Harry, no! 

            
Remus! 
 Ginny, stay with your mother! Without hesitation, she races for
                the reeds. 
 No, Harry! It’s a trap! 
 Don’t you smell clean. 
 You’re lucky you weren’t killed. 
 You have to realize who you are, Harry. 

                
 I know who I am, Hermione, alright?
                    
 Sorry. 
 So tell me what Arthur said. 
 If Dumbledore’s traveling places, it’s news to the Ministry. But get
                this: that night at Borgin & Burkes? It seems Draco was looking at a Vanishing
                Cabinet. 
 What would Draco want with a Vanishing Cabinet? 
 You tell me. 

            
 He looks different, don’t you think? Draco. Almost... ill. 
 Who could tell the difference? 
 Lav, c’mon. Of course I’ll wear it. 

            
 That’s my Won-Won. 
 Excuse me, I have to go vomit. 

            
 Sir, is it true that Professor Merrythought is retiring? 
 Now, Tom, I couldn’t tell you if I knew, could I? I must say,
                m’boy, I’d like to know where you get your information. More knowledgeable than half
                the staff, you are.
 By the way, thank you for
                the pineapple -- you’re quite right, it is my favorite -- how is it you knew? 
 Intuition. 
 Good gracious, look at the time. Off you go, boys, or Professor
                Dippett will have us all in detention. Lestrange, Avery, don’t forget your essays...
                    
 Look sharp, Tom. You don’t want to be caught out of bed after
                hours... 
 I know a secret shortcut or two. 
 Yes, I imagine you do. Something on your mind, Tom? 
 Yes, sir. I couldn’t think of anyone else to go to. The other
                professors, well, they’re not like you. They might... misunderstand. 
 Go on. 
 I was in the library the other night, in the Restricted section,
                and I read something rather odd, about a bit of rare magic, and I thought perhaps
                you could illuminate me... 
 I don’t know anything about such things and I wouldn’t tell you if
                I did! Now get out of here at once and don’t ever let me catch you mentioning it
                again! The FOG grows thicker and... 
 Confused? I would be surprised if you weren’t. 
 I don’t understand -- what happened? 
 This is perhaps the most important memory I’ve collected. It’s
                also a lie. (off Harry’s look) This memory has been tampered with. In this case by
                the person whose memory it is, our friend Professor Slughorn. 
 But why would he tamper with his own memory? 
 I suspect he is ashamed of it. Why? 
 Why indeed. 
 Dumbledore trails his withered fingers in the Pensieve. 
 I asked you to get to know Professor Slughorn and you’ve done so.
                Now I want you to persuade him to divulge his true memory. Any way you can. 
 I don’t know him that well, sir -- 
 You’re the Chosen One, Harry. And Horace is, at heart, a decent
                man. Provide the proper circumstances and he will confess his sins. 
 This memory is everything, Harry. Without it, we are blind.
                Without it, we leave the fate of our world to chance. You have no choice. You must
                not fail. 
 Now don’t forget to look over the chapter on antidotes. I’ll be
                poisoning one of you next time we meet. I’m joking! Off you go! Don’t forget your
                rattails, Miss Alys. 

            
 Ah! If it isn’t the Prince of Potions himself! To what do I owe the
                pleasure? 
 Well, sir, I wondered if I might ask you something. 
 Ask away, my dear boy, ask away! 
 Well, you see, the other day I was in the Restricted Section -- in the
                library -- and I stumbled upon something rather odd while reading. Something about a
                bit of rare magic... 
 Yes? And exactly what was this rare magic. 
 I’m not sure... That is, I don’t recall the name... exactly. But it
                got me wondering... Are there some kinds of magic you’re not allowed to teach?
                    

            
 I’m a Potions Professor, Harry. Perhaps your question would best be
                posed to Professor Snape. 
 Yes, well, we don’t exactly see eye-to-eye, sir. What I mean to say
                is, he’s not like you. He might... misunderstand. 

            
 There can be no light without the dark. And so it is with magic.
                Myself, I have always strived to live within the light. I suggest you do the same.
                    

            
 Did you say the same to Tom Riddle, sir? When he came asking
                questions. 

            
 Dumbledore put you up to this. Didn’t he? Didn’t he! 
 Sir -- 

            
 Did you actually expect you could just walk up to Ol’ Sluggy and
                ask him to reveal his deepest, darkest secret? Honestly, Harry, sometimes I think
                the Daily Prophet should call you the Dim One. 
 Nice. 

                
 You’re going to have to persuade him somehow. And now,
                I’m afraid, you’ve made it a lot harder. 
 Hermione. I think Malfoy’s leaving the castle. 

            
 I’ve seen it. Sometimes... sometimes he just disappears off the Map. 
 That’s... not possible. No one can leave the castle these days. The
                Map is wrong. 
 The Map is never wrong. 

            
 It’s beautiful, isn’t it? The moon. 
 Divine. Had ourselves a little late-night snack, did we? 
 It was on your bed. The box. Thought I’d try one... 
 Or twenty. 
 I can’t stop thinking about her, Harry. 
 Really? Honestly, I reckoned she was starting to annoy you. 
 She could never annoy me. I think... I think I love her. 
 Excuse me? 

            
 Well... Brilliant. 
 Do you think she knows I exist? 
 Bloody well hope so. She’s been snogging you for three months. 
 Snogging? Who’re you talking about? 
 Who’re you talking about? 
 Romilda, of course. Romilda Vane. 

            
 Okay. Very funny. 

            
 What the hell was that for? 
 It’s no joke! I’m in love with her! 
 Okay! Fine! You’re in love with her! Have you ever actually met her! 
 No. Can you introduce me? 

            
 Ron, these chocolates, they’re -- C’mon. I’m going to introduce you to
                Romilda Vane. 
 How do I look? 
 Devastatingly handsome. 

            
 Damn it all! 

            
 Yes???!!!! 
 Oh. Potter. It’s you. I’m afraid
                I’m busy at the moment -- 

            
 Sir. I’m sorry. I wouldn’t bother you if it weren’t absolutely -- 
 Where’s Romilda? 

            
 What’s the matter with Wenby? 

            
 Ah. Very well. Bring him in. 
 I’d have thought you could whip up a remedy for this in no time,
                Harry -- an expert potioneer like you. 
 I figured this called for a more practiced hand, sir. 
 Hello, darling. Fancy a drink? 
 Hm. Perhaps you’re right. 
 I’m sorry, sir. About the other day. Our... misunderstanding. 
 Yes, well, water under the bridge as they say, correct? 
 I mean, I’m sure you’re tired of it, after all these years. The
                questions. About... Voldemort. 
 I’ll ask you not to use that name. 
 Yes, sir. It’s just, well, Dumbledore once said that fear of a name
                only increases fear of the thing itself. It seemed sensible. 
 With all due respect, Dumbledore sometimes forgets that most of us
                do not possess powers so great that we can risk offending the most dangerous Dark
                Lord who ever lived. 
 Alright, m’boy! Bottoms up! 
 What’s this? 
 A tonic for the nerves. 
 What happened to me? 
 Love potion. 
 And a bloody strong one at that. 
 I feel really... bad. 
 Pick-me-up’s what you need, m’boy. 

                Do us all good, I think. I’ve got butterbeer, wine -- ah -- and a dazzling
                oak-matured mead. I had other intentions for this but given the circumstances...
                    
 There we are, Potter. To life! 
 Ron! Ron!!! Professor, help him! 
 I d-don’t understand - 
 Professor! Do something!! 

            
 He’s choking!! 

            
 Breathe! C’mon, Ron, don’t be a prat. Breathe! BREATHE! 

            
 These girls are gonna kill me, Harry. 

            
 Quick thinking on your part, Harry. Using a Bezoar. You must be
                very proud of your student, eh, Horace? 
 Hm? Oh. Yes... very proud. 
 I think we all agree that Mr. Potter’s actions were heroic. The
                question is: Why were they necessary. 
 Why indeed. 
 This appears to be a gift, Horace. You don’t by chance remember
                who gave you this bottle, do you -- which by the way possesses remarkably subtle
                hints of licorice and cherry when not polluted with poison. 
 Actually I had intended to give it as a gift myself. 
 To whom might I ask? 
 You, Headmaster. 
 Where is he? Where’s my Won-Won! Has he been asking for me?
                    
 What’s she doing here? 
 I might ask you the same. 
 I happen to be his girlfriend. 
 I happen to be his... friend. 
 Don’t make me laugh. You haven’t spoken in weeks. I suppose
                you want to make up with him now that he’s suddenly all interesting. 
 He’s been poisoned, you daft dimbo! And for the record, I’ve always
                found him interesting. 
 Ha! See? He senses my presence. I’m here, Won-Won. I’m here - 
 Er... My... Nee... Er! My! Nee! 
 Ah, to be young and feel love’s keen sting. Come, everyone, I
                think Mr. Weasley is well tended. 
 ‘Bout time, don’t you think? 
 I’ve always cherished my students. They’re my life... 
 Oh shut up. 
 Ron. Stop. You’re making it snow. 
 Huh? 
 Tell me again how I broke up withLavender? 
 Um, well, she came to visit you in the hospital, you see, and you
                talked -- I don’t believe it was a long conversation - 
 Don’t get me wrong. I’m bloody thrilled to be shot of her. It’s just she
                seems... a bit put out. 
 Does, doesn’t she? And you say you don’t remember a thing from that
                night? Not one thing? 
 Well... there is... something. 
 But no.
                It can’t be. Besides, I was completely boggled, wasn’t I? 
 Right. Boggled... 
 That’s Katie. That’s Katie Bell. 
 How are you, Katie? 
 Give me a moment, girls. 
 I know you’re going to ask, Harry. But I don’t know who cursed me.
                I’ve tried to remember. Honestly. But I just... can’t... 
 Cruci- 
 SECTUMSEMPRA! 
 Don’t touch me! Don’t you dare touch me! Harry stops dead...
                transfixed by a FLASH of SOMETHING DARK pushing through the wet fabric of Malfoy’s
                shirtsleeve. Just then... Snape BURSTS THROUGH THE DOOR. Seeing Malfoy -- and the
                nature of his injuries -- he eyes Harry with keen curiosity. Kneeling, he traces
                the TIP of his WAND over Malfoy’s wounds, MURMURING an EERIE INCANTATION. Instantly,
                the skin begins to knit itself together. Harry backs away, Snape’s ancient CHANT
                ringing in his ears, blood floating like crimson flowers on the floor, backing away
                until he reaches the door... 
 You have to get rid of it. Today. 
 Take my hand. 
 The Room of Requirement... Ginny nods, turns away. Harry follows. 
 Over the years, if someone had a secret, if they wanted to conceal
                something, this is where they came. Some of these things are almost as old as the
                castle itself. 
 Who showed you this? First. 
 Fred and George. First year. I hid Tom Riddle’s diary here for a time.
                Wish I’d left it... 

            
 What was that? 
 See, you never know what you’ll find up here. 

            
 All right. Close your eyes. That way you can’t be tempted.
                    

            
 There’s something else. Another secret of sorts. One of mine...
                    

            
 That can stay hidden up here too, if you like. 

            
 So. Did you and Ginny do it? 
 What? 
 You know. Hide the book. 
 Oh. Yeah. 
 Still no luck with Slughorn, I take it? 
 Say that again. 
 Well? How do you feel? 
 Excellent. Really excellent. 
 Now remember. Slughorn usually eats early, takes a short walk and
                then returns to his office. 
 Right. I’m going down to Hagrid’s. 
 What? No, Harry -- you’ve got to go see Slughorn. We have a plan - 
 No. I’ve got a good feeling about going to Hagrid’s. I feel like it’s
                the place to be tonight, know what I mean? 
 No. 
 Trust me. I know what I’m doing. Or at least Felix does. 
 Merlin’s beard, Harry! 
 Sorry, sir. I should’ve announced myself. Cleared my throat. Coughed.
                You probably feared I was Madam Sprout. 
 Well, yes, actually - 
 Why would you think
                that? 
 Just the general behavior, sir. The sneaking around. The jumping when
                you saw me. By the way, those Tentacula leaves -- they’re quite valuable, aren’t
                they? 
 Ten galleons a leaf to the right buyer -- not that I’m familiar
                with such back alley transactions. One hears rumors is all. My own interests are
                purely academic, of course. 
 Personally, these plants have always kind of freaked me out.
                    

            
 Exactly how did you get out of the castle, Harry? 
 Through the front doors, sir. I’m off to Hagrid’s, you see. He’s a
                very dear friend and I felt like paying him a visit. So if you don’t mind, I’ll be
                going. 
 Harry! 
 Sir? 
 It’s nearly nightfall. Surely you realize I can’t allow you to roam
                the grounds all by yourself. 
 Well, then by all means come along, sir. 
 Harry, I must insist you accompan yme back to the castle
                immediately! 
 That would be counterproductive, sir. 
 And what makes you say that? 
 No idea. 
 Merlin’s beard... 
 Is that an actual Acromantula? 
 A dead one, I think, sir. 
 ‘Arry. ‘Orace. 
 My god, dear man. How did you ever manage to kill it? 
 Kill ‘im! Me oldest friend, ‘e was! 
 I’m sorry, I... (didn’t realize.) 
 Ah, don’ worry yerself. Yer not alone. Seriously misunderstood
                creatures -- spiders. It’s the eyes, I reckon. Unnerve people. 
 Not to mention the pincers. 
 I reckon that too... How’d yeh get outta the castle anyways? 
 Through the front doors. 
 Hagrid. I wouldn’t want to be indelicate, but Acromantula venom is
                uncommonly rare and, well, if you wouldn’t mind my extracting a vial or two --
                purely for academic pursuits... 
 Don’ suppose it’s doin’ ‘im any good, izzit? 
 My thoughts exactly! Always carry a few spare ampoules for just
                such occasions. Old Potion Master’s habit, you know... 
 Wish yeh coulda seen ‘im in ‘is prime. Magnificent ‘e was. Jus’
                magnificent... 
 Why don’t I say a few words? I trust he had family? 
 Oh yeah. 

                
 Farewell... 
 Aragog. 

                
 Farewell, Aragog, king of arachnids. Though your body will
                decay, your spirit lingers on in the quiet, web-spun places of your Forest home. May
                your many-eyed descendents ever flourish and your human friends find solace for the
                loss they have sustained. 
 Tha’ was... tha’ was... beautiful. 

                
 To the place he’d known as a lad, They laid him to rest
                with his hat inside out and his wand snapped in two, which was sad... 
 I had ‘im from an egg, yeh know. Tiny little thing he was when he
                hatched. No bigger’n a Pekinese. 
 Sweet. I once had a fish. Francis. Lovely little thing. One day I
                came downstairs and he’d vanished. Poof. 
 Tha’s odd. 
 Isn’t it? That’s life, I suppose. One goes along and then...poof. 
 Poof. 
 Poof. 
 That’s never unicorn hair, Hagrid? 
 But my dear chap, do you know how much that’s worth? 
 No idea... no idea at all... 
 It was a student who gave me Francis. One spring afternoon I
                discovered a bowl upon my desk with a few inches of clear water. There was a flower
                petal floating upon the surface. As I watched, the petal sank, but just before it
                touched bottom... it transformed. Into a wee fish. It was beautiful magic, wondrous
                to behold. The petal had come from a lily. 
 Your mother. The day I came downstairs, the day I found the bowl
                empty... was the day she... 
 I know what you want. But I can’t give it to you. It will ruin
                me... 
 Do you know why I survived? The night I got this. 
 Because of her. Because she sacrificed herself. Because she refused to
                step aside. Because her love was more powerful than Voldemort. 
 Please don’t say his - 
 I’m not afraid of the name, Professor. And I’m not afraid of him. And
                you shouldn’t be either. She didn’t just die for me that night. She died for you
                too. She died for everyone who’s ever woken in the middle of the night afraid a
                Death Eater waited on their doorstep. 
 Professor. I’m going to tell you something, something others have only
                guessed at. It’s true. I am the Chosen One. 
 Only I can kill him. But in order to do so, I need to know what Tom
                Riddle asked you that night in your office all those years ago. And I need to know
                what you told him. 
 Be brave, Professor. Be brave like my mother. Otherwise you disgrace
                her. Otherwise she died for nothing. Otherwise, the bowl remains empty forever.
                    
 Don’t think too badly of me once you’ve seen it. You don’t know
                what he was like... even then. 

            
 How is he? Horace? 

            
 Sir, is it true that Professor Merrythought is retiring? 
 Now, Tom, I couldn’t tell you if I knew, could I? I must say,
                m’boy, I’d like to know where you get your information. More knowledgable than half
                the staff, you are. 
 By the way, thank you for
                the pineapple -- you’re quite right, it is my favorite -- how is it you knew? 
 Intuition. 

                
 Good gracious, is it that time already? Off you go,
                boys, or Professor Dippett will have us all in detention. Lestrange, Avery, don’t
                forget your essays... 
 Look sharp, Tom. You don’t want to be caught out of bed after
                hours... 
 I know a secret shortcut or two. 
 Yes, I imagine you do. Something on your mind, Tom? 
 Yes, sir. I couldn’t think of anyone else to go to. The other
                Professors, well, they’re not like you. They might... misunderstand. 
 Go on. 
 I was in the library the other night, in the Restricted section,
                and I read something rather odd, about a bit of rare magic and I thought perhaps you
                could illuminate me. It’s called, as I understand it... a Horcrux. 
 Excuse me? 
 Horcrux. I came across the term while reading and I didn’t fully
                understand it. 
 I’m not sure what you were reading, Tom, but that’s very Dark
                stuff, very Dark indeed. 
 Yes, sir. Which is why I came to you. I mean no disrespect to the
                rest of the staff, but I thought if anyone could tell me... it would be you. 
 A Horcrux is an object in which a person has concealed part of
                their soul. 
 Yes, I thought it might be something like that. But I don’t
                understand how that works, sir. 
 One splits one’s soul and hides part of it in an object. By doing
                so, you are protected should you be attacked and your body destroyed. 
 Protected? 
 That part of your soul that was hidden, lives on. In other words,
                you cannot die. 
 How does one split his soul, sir? 
 I think you can guess the answer to that, Tom. 
 Murder. 
 Yes. Killing rips the soul apart. It is a violation against nature.
                After, one is never the same. 
 Out of curiosity, sir -- can you only split your soul once? For
                instance, isn’t seven the most powerfully magical number - 
 Seven! Merlin’s beard, Tom! Isn’t it bad enough to think of killing
                one person? To rip the soul into seven pieces... 

                This is all hypothetical, isn’t it, Tom? All academic... 
 Of course, sir. And I promise I’ll not speak of our conversation.
                It’ll be our little secret... 
 Sir -

                
 This is beyond anything I imagined. In my life I have seen
                things that are unimaginably horrific. I know now... you will see worse. 
 Do you mean to say he succeeded, sir? In making a Horcrux? 
 Oh he succeeded. And not just once. Think, Harry. He’s just told
                us. 
 Seven. He made seven -- the most powerfully magical number. But...
                what are they exactly? 
 They can be anything. The most commonplace of objects. A ring,
                for example. Or a book... 
 Tom Riddle’s diary - 
 It’s a Horcrux, yes. Four years ago, when you saved Ginny
                Weasley’s life in the Chamber of Secrets, when you brought me this - 
 I knew. This was a different kind of magic. Very dark. Very
                powerful. But until tonight, I had no idea just how powerful... 
 And the ring...? 
 Belonged to Voldemort’s mother. It was difficult to find and...
                    
 ... even more difficult to destroy. 
 But if you could find them all. If you did destroy each Horcrux... 
 One destroys Voldemort. 
 But how would you find them? They could be hidden anywhere, couldn’t
                they... 
 True. But magic, especially Dark magic... 
 ... leaves traces. 
 It’s where you’ve been going, isn’t it, sir? When you leave the
                school. 
 Yes. And I think... perhaps... I may have found another. But this
                time I cannot hope to destroy it alone. 
 Once again, I shall ask too much of you. 
 Harry. It’s time. 
 Hermione, is the Room of Requirement unplottable? 
 If one wants it to be. Why? 
 It would explain why I thought Malfoy was leaving the castle when he
                disappeared off the Map. 
 He was going to the Room of Requirement. 
 Of course, and that explains the Vanishing Cabinet as well! 
 No. I got an owl from Dad this morning. The one at Borgin & Burke’s?
                It’s still there. 
 But I’m telling you. I saw it -- 

            
 What if there are two? Vanishing cabinets. 
 What if there are? 
 I don’t know... 

            
 Good luck, mate. 

            
 I don’t need luck. I’ll be with Dumbledore. 
 Have you ever considered that you ask too much? That you take too much
                for granted? Has it ever crossed your brilliant mind that I don’t want to do this
                anymore? 
 Whether it has or hasn’t is irrelevant. I will not negotiate this
                with you, Severus. You agreed. There’s nothing more to discuss. 
 Harry. You need a shave, my friend. 
 At times I forget how much you’ve grown. At times I still see the
                small boy from the cupboard. 
 Forgive my mawkishness, Harry. I
                am an old man. 
 You look the same to me, sir. 
 Like your mother, you are unfailingly kind. A trait people never
                fail to undervalue. I’m afraid. 
 The place to which we journey tonight is exceedingly dangerous,
                Harry. I promised that you could accompany me and I stand by that promise. But there
                is a condition: You must obey any command I give you -- without question. 
 Yes, sir. 
 Understand what I’m saying. Should I tell you to hide, you must
                hide. Harry nods. 
 Should I tell you to run, you will run. 
 And should I tell you to abandon me and save yourself... 
 You will do so. 
 Your word, Harry. Harry debates this internally, then, finally,
                nods. 
 My word. 
 Take my arm. 
 Sir, I thought one couldn’t Apparate within Hogwarts. 
 Being me has its privileges. 
 It’s there, isn’t it? 
 This is the place. Oh yes, this place has known magic.
                    
 Where you stand, Harry, Tom Riddle once stood
                many, many years ago, when he was but a poor orphan boy with a penchant for
                cruelty... 

            
 One wintry afternoon, he lured two younger classmates to this
                cave. What happened is unclear. But this much is known: the children were damaged.
                    

            
 Sir! 

            
 In order to gain passage, payment must be made, payment intended
                to weaken any intruder. 
 You should’ve let me, sir. 
 Oh, no, Harry. Your blood is much more precious than mine. 
 Careful. The water. 
 It’s there. The only question is how do we get to it? 
 We couldn’t, perhaps, just try a Summoning Charm, sir? 
 Accio Horcrux! 
 Perhaps not. 
 If you would, Harry... 
 Sir... have you ever taken Felix Felicis? 
 Only recreationally. You see, I believe one creates one’s own
                luck. 
 Professor... there are bodies in this lake. 
 Yes. 
 Remember... the water. 
 Do you think the Horcrux is in there, sir? 
 Oh yes. 
 It has to be drunk. 
 You remember
                the condition on which I brought you with me? 
 This potion might paralyze me. It might cause me to forget why
                I’m here. It might create so much pain I beg for relief. You are not to indulge
                these requests, Harry. It is your job to make sure I keep drinking this potion even
                if you have to force it down my throat. Understood? 
 Why can’t I drink it, sir? 
 Because I am much older, much cleverer... and much less valuable.
                    
 Your good health, Harry. 
 Professor? 
 Professor? Can you hear me? 
 Don’t... don’t make me... 
 You... you can’t stop, Professor. You’ve got to keep drinking. Like
                you said. Remember. 
 Nooooooo!!! 
 Make it stop... Please... make it stop... 
 It will, sir. It’ll stop. But only if you drink... 
 My fault. It’s all my fault... 
 Too much... I can’t... take it... I want... to die... kill...
                kill me... KILL ME, HARRY! 
 What? 
 Your word, Harry! Your word! 
 No... 
 KILL ME! IT’S THE ONLY WAY! 
 One more. Just one more. And then -- I promise... I’ll do what you
                say. 
 I promise. 
 Water. 
 Water... 
 Aguamenti. 
 You did it, sir. Look -
 Water! 
 I’m trying, sir. I’m -
 Go... 

            
 We have to... go. 

            
 Don’t worry, sir. We’re nearly there. 
 I am not worried, Harry. I am with you. 
 To your Houses. No dawdling. 

            
 We need to get you up to the hospital, sir, to Madam Pomfrey - 
 No. Severus... Severus is who I need... Go and wake him... Tell
                him what has happened...Speak to no one else... I... I shall wait here... 
 All right. Okay. 
 Sir, are you... praying? 

                
 No, Harry. I do not pray. I was merely closing a
                window -- the one that had allowed us to Apparate. 
 Hide yourself below. And do not speak or show yourself without my
                permission. No matter what. 
 Do as I say, Harry. 
 Trust me. 
 Good evening, Draco. What brings you out on such a fine Spring
                evening? Or is it Summer? 
 Who else is here? I heard you talking. 
 I often talk aloud to myself. I find it extraordinarily useful.
                That which sounds sane at a whisper can seem utterly mad when said for all the world
                to hear. Haven’t been whispering to yourself, have you, Draco? 
 You are not an assassin, Draco. 
 How do you know what I am? I’ve done things that would shock you. 
 Like cursing Katie Bell and hoping she would, in turn, bear a
                cursed necklace to me? Like replacing a bottle of mead with one laced with poison.
                Forgive me, Draco, but these are attempts so feeble I cannot help but question if
                your heart has been really in them. I’m curious. When Voldemort gave you this task,
                when he asked you to kill me, was it in a whisper? 
 He trusts me! I was chosen! 
 Then I shall make it easy for you. 
 Expelliarumus! 
 Well done, Draco. But I warn you. Killing is not nearly as easy.
                    
 You’re not alone. Are you. There are others. How? 
 The Vanishing Cabinet in the Room of Requirement. 
 That cabinet has been broken for years. 
 I’ve been mending it. 
 Ingenious. Let me guess. It has a sister. A twin. 
 In Borgin & Burkes. They form - 
 A passage, yes. Very good. 
 I once
                knew a boy years ago who made all the wrong choices. Let me help you, Draco. 
 I don’t want your help! Don’t you see! I have to do it! I have to!
                    
 I’ve got to kill you or he’ll kill me. 
 Say that again, Draco. But aloud this time. 
 Well now, look what we have here. Dumbledore. Wandless and alone.
                Cornered in his own castle. Well done, Draco. 
 Good evening, Bellatrix. I think introductions are in order. 
 Love to, Albus. But I’m afraid we’re on a bit of a tight schedule.
                    
 Do it. 

            
 He doesn’t have the stomach. Like his father. Let me finish him. In
                my own way. 
 No! The Dark Lord was clear. The boy’s to do it. Go on, Draco.
                Now! 
 No. 
 Severus... 
 Well, look who’s here. Hogwarts own Defense Against the Dark Arts
                teacher. Come to see the slaughter? 
 Severus... please. 
 I gave my word. I made a vow... 
 Avada Kedavra! 
 You can no longer stay here. 
 Boo. 
 Draco! Draco! 
 They’ll kill you if you
                stay. 
 Go on! 
 Go on! 
 Cruciatus! 

            
 Incacerata! 

            
 Impedimenta! 

            
 Fight! Fight back, you coward! 

            
 Don’t ever associate that word and my name again. 

            
 No! He belongs to the Dark Lord! 

            
 Sectumsempra! 

            
 You dare use my own spells against me, Potter? 
 You may have gotten your mother’s eyes, but you’re as dim as your
                father. Yes. It’s me. I’m the Half-Blood Prince. 

            
 Hagrid... HAGRID! 

            
 Hagrid! You alright? 
 Take more’n tha’ ter finish me off. Not sure about me ‘ouse, tho’.
                But if anybody can put it righ’, Dumbledore can. 
 Hagrid, Dumbledore - 
 Only thing I can’t reckon is wha’ Snape was doin’ with tha’ lot.
                    

            
 An’ wha’s this wi’ the Dark Mar’? Who’s been killed?
                    
 Where’s Dumbledore, ‘arry? Where’s Dumbledore!!
                    

            
 Potter, in light of what’s happened... should you feel the need
                to talk to someone... 
 You should know... Professor Dumbledore... 

            
 You meant a great deal to him. 

            
 Do you think he would’ve done it. Draco? 
 No. He was lowering his wand. In the end, it was Snape. It was always
                Snape. And I did nothing... 

            
 Strange. Thinking this is a piece of Voldemort’s soul... 
 Yeah, strange. Only... it’s not. It’s a fake. 

            
 Go on. Open it. 

            
 ‘To the Dark Lord. I know I will be dead long before you read this
                but I want you to know that it was I who discovered your secret. I have stolen the
                real Horcrux and intend to destroy it as soon as I can. I face death in the hope
                that when you meet your match, you will be mortal once more. R.A.B.’ 
 R.A.B.? 
 Dunno. But whoever they are, they have the real Horcrux. Which means,
                it was a waste. All of it. 

            
 Ron’s okay with it, you know. and Ginny. But if I were you, when
                he’s around, I’d keep the snogging to a minimum. 

            
 I’m not coming back, Hermione. Hermione nods. 
 We reckoned --Ron and me. 
 I have to finish what Dumbledore started. I’m not sure where that will
                lead me... but I’ll let you and Ron know where I am -- when I can. 

            
 I’ve always admired your courage, Harry, but sometimes... you’re
                really thick. 

            
 You don’t honestly think you can find all those Horcruxes by
                yourself, do you? 
 You need us, Harry.
                    

            
 Yeah. I do. But do me a favor. When I’m around? Keep the snogging to a
                minimum. 

            
 Like that’s going to happen. 

            
 Besides, he’s barking. 
 Funny, he says the same about you. 
 Yes, but I’m exceptionally perceptive. 
 You’re brilliant. You both are. 

            
 Do you think we’ll ever... (comeback?) 

            
 I don’t know. 

            
 Bloody kids.
 Oh no no no my Lord Voldemort. I only meant... perhaps if we were
                to do it without the boy.. 
 NO! The boy is everything, it cannot be done without him and it
                WILL be done exactly as I say. 
 I will not disappoint you my lord. 
 Good. First, gather our old comrades. Send them a sign.
 Nagini tells me the old caretaker is standing outside the
                    door.
 Step aside so I can give our guest a proper greeting. 
 Harry!
 Are you alright? 
 Hermione. Bad dream. When did you get here? 
 Just now. You? 
 Last night.
 Wake up. Wake up Ronald! 
 Bloody hell. 
 Honestly. Get dressed, and don't go back to sleep. Come on Ron!
                Your mother says breakfast's ready. 
 Where are we actually going? 
 Don't know. Hey Dad! Where are we going? 
 Haven't the foggiest, keep up! 
 Arthur! It's about time son. 
 Sorry Amos. Some of us had a bit of a sleepy start. This is Amos
                Diggory everyone, he works with me at the ministry. And this strapping young lad
                must be Cedric, am I right? 
 Yes sir. 
 Merlin's beard, you must be Harry Potter. 
 Yes sir. This way. 
 Great great pleasure.
 Pleasure to meet you too sir.
 That's it sir, just over there. 
 Shall we? We don't want to be late.
 Why are they all standing around that manky old boot? 
 That isn't just any old manky boot mate. 
 It's a portkey.
 Time to go. Ready? 
 What's a 'portkey'? 
 After 3. One... Two... 
 Harry!
 Three!
 Let go kids! 
 What?? 
 Let! Go!
 I bet that cleared your sinuses eh?
 Thanks.
 Well kids, welcome to the Quidditch World Cup!
 Parting of the waves I think old chap, see you at the match.
 See ya later Cedric. 
 Home sweet home. 
 Girls. Choose a bunk and unpack. Ron, get out of the kitchen we're
                all hungry. 
 Yeah get out of the kitchen Ron. 
 Feet off the table. 
 Feet off the table.

                
 I love magic. 
 Blimey Dad, how far up ARE we?
 Well put it this way, if it rains... you'll be the first to
                know 
 Father and I are in the minister's box, by personal invitation of
                Cornelius Fudge himself. 
 Don't boast Draco. There's no need with these people. Do enjoy
                yourself won't you. While you can.
 Come on up, take your seats. I told you these seats would be worth
                waiting for. 
 Come on! 
 It's the Irish!
 Here come the Bulgarians!
 Krum!!! 
 Yes!
 Good evening! It gives me great pleasure to welcome each and every
                one of you to the final of the 422nd Quidditch World Cup. Let the match begin! 
 There's no one like Krum. He's like a bird the way he rides the wind.
                He's more than an athlete, he's an artist.
 Think you're in love Ron? 

                
 Viktor I love you! Viktor I do!
 When we're apart my heart beats only for youuu! 
 Sounds like the irish have got their pride on. 
 Stop! Stop it. It's not the irish. We've gotta get out of here.
                Now. 
 Get back to the portkey everybody, and stick together. Fred,
                George... Ginny is your responsibility.
 Been looking for you for ages. Thought we lost you. 
 What is THAT?
 Stop! That's my son.
 Ron, Harry, Hermione are you alright? 
 Which of you conjured this? 
 You can't possibly.. 
 Do not lie! You have been discovered at the scene of the crime! 
 Crime? 
 Barty, they're just kids. 
 What crime? 
 Harry it's his mark. 
 Those people tonight, in the masks... they're his too aren't they?
                they're his followers. 
 Follow me. 
 There was a man. Before. There. 
 All of you, this way. 
 Harry, who? 
 I dunno. I didn't see his face. 

                
 Anything from the trolley? Anything from the
                    trolley?
 Anything from the trolley dears? 
 Packet of drewbals and a liquorice wand.
 On second thought, just the drewbals. 
 It's alright I'll get it. 
 Just the drewbals, thanks.
 Two pumpkin pasties please.
 Thank you. 
 Anything sweet for you dear? 
 Oh no thank you I'm not hungry. 
 This is horrible, how can the ministry not know who conjured it.
                Isn't there any security or? 
 Loads according to Dad, that's what worried them so much. Happened right
                under their noses.
 It's hurting again isn't it, your scar. 
 I'm fine. 
 You know Sirius will want to hear about this. What you saw at the
                world cup, and the dream.
 Clear the runway. 
 Well there's something you don't see every day.
 Now we're all settled in and sorted, I'd like to make an
                announcement. This castle will not only be your home this year but home to some very
                special guests as well. You see Hogwarts has been choosen...
 So Hogwarts has been choosen to host a legendary event. The
                Tri-Wizard tournament. Now for those of you who do not know, the tri-wizard
                tournament brings together three schools for a series of magical contests. From each
                school a single contestant is selected to compete. Now let me be clear, if choosen
                you stand alone. And trust me when I say these contests are not for the faint
                hearted, but more of that later. For now please join me in welcoming the lovely
                ladies of the Beauxbatons Academy of magic and their headmistress Madam
                    Maxime.
 Blimey, that's one big woman. 
 And now our friends from the north, please greet the proud sons
                of Durmstrang and the high master Igor Karkaroff.
 Blimey it's him, Viktor Krum!
 Albus! 
 Igor.
 Professor Dumbledore, my horses have travelled a long way. They
                will need attending to. 
 Not to worry Madame Maxime, our gamekeeper Hagrid's more than
                capable of seeing to them. 
 But you know Monsieur Hagrid, they drink only single malt
                    whiskey.
 You idiot! 
 Your attention please! I would like to say a few words. Eternal
                glory, that is what awaits the student who wins the tri-wizard tournament. But to do
                this that student must survive three tasks. Three extremely dangerous tasks. 
 Wicked. 
 For this reason the ministry has seen fit to impose a new rule.
                To explain all this we have the head of the department of international magic
                cooperation Mister Bartimus Crouch.
 Bloody hell, it's Mad-Eye Moody. 
 Alastor Moody? The aura. 
 He was a catcher. Half the cells in Azkaban are full thanks to him. He's
                supposed to be mad as a hatter though these days.
 My dear old friend, thanks for coming. 
 That stupid roof.
 What's that he's drinking do you suppose? 
 I don't know but I don't think it's Pumpkin Juice. 
 After much deliberation the ministry has concluded that for their own
                safety no student under the age of seventeen shall be allowed to put forth their
                name for the tri-wizard tournament. This decision is final.
 That's rubbish! You don't know what you're doing! 
 Silence!
 The goblet of fire. Anyone wishing to submit themselves for the
                tournament merely write their name upon a piece of parchment and throw it in the
                flame before this hour on Thursday night. Do not do so lightly, if choosen there's
                no turning back. As from this moment the tri-wizard tournament has begun. 
 Alastor Moody.
 Ministry malcontent. And your new defence against the dark arts
                teacher. I'm here because Dumbledore asked me, end of story, goodbye, the end. Any
                questions? When it comes to the dark arts, I believe in a practical approach. But
                first, which of you can tell me how many unforgivable curses there are? 
 Three sir. 
 And they are so named? 
 Because they are unforgivable. Use of any one of them will... 
 Will earn you a one way ticket to Azkaban. Correct. Now the ministry
                says you're too young to see what these curses do. I say different! You need to know
                what you're up against, you need to be prepared, you need to find somewhere else to
                put your chewing gum other than the underside of your desk Mr Finnigan! 
 Aw no way, the old codger can see out the back of his head.
 So, which curse shall we see first? WEASLEY! 
 Yes... 
 Give us a curse. 
 Well, my dad did tell me about one... The imperious curse. 
 Ahhh yes, your father would know all about that. Gave the ministry
                quite a bit of grief a few years ago. Perhaps this will show you why.
 Hello. What a little beauty.
 Don't worry. Completely harmless.
 But if she bites... she's lethal!
 What are you laughing at?
 Talented isn't she? What shall I have her do next? Jump out the
                window? Drown herself?
 Scores of witches and wizards have claimed that they only do did
                you-know-whose bidding under the influence of the imperious curse. But here's the
                rub, how do we sort out the liars? Another.. another.. Come on come on. Longbottom
                is it? Up.
 Professor Sprout tells me you have an aptitude for herbology. 
 There's the um... The cruciatus curse. 
 Correct! Correct! come come. Particularly nasty. The torture
                    curse.
 Stop it! Can't you see it's bothering him, stop it!
 Perhaps you could give us the last unforgivable curse Miss
                    Granger.
 The killing curse. Only one person is known to have survived it. And
                he's sitting in this room.
 Brilliant isn't he! Completely demented of course. Terrifying to be in
                the same room with, he's really BEEN there you know. 
 There's a reason those curses are unforgivable, and to perform them
                in a classroom. I mean did you see Neville's face.
 Neville?
 Son. You alright?
 Come on, we'll have a cup of tea. I want to show you something. 
 Eternal glory, be brilliant wouldn't it? In three years from now we'll
                be old enough to be choosen. 
 Yeah well rather you than me.
 Thank you thank you, well lads we've done it. 
 Cooked it up just this morning. 
 It's not going to work. 
 Oh yeah? And why's that Granger. 
 You see this? This is an age line. Dumbledore drew it himself. 
 So? 
 So a genius like Dumbledore couldn't possibly be fooled by
                something pathetically dimwitted such as an age potion. 
 That's why it's so brilliant. 
 Ready Fred? 
 Ready George?
 You said..
 Sit down please. And now the moment you've all been waiting for,
                the champions selection!
 The Durmstrang champion is ... Viktor Krum!
 The champion from Beauxbatons... Fleur Delacour
 The Hogwarts champion... Cedric Diggory.
 Excellent! we now have our three champions! But in the end only
                one will go down in history. Only one will hoist this chalice of champions, this
                vessel of victory the tri-wizard cup!
 Harry Potter. Harry Potter? 
 No... No. 
 Harry Potter! 
 Go on Harry. Harry for goodness sake.
 He's a cheat! He's not even seventeen yet. 
 Harry! Did you put your name in the goblet of fire? 
 No sir. 
 Did you ask one of the older students to do it for you? 
 No sir. 
 You're absolutely sure? 
 Yes sir. 
 Well of course he is lying. 
 The hell he is. The goblet of fire is an exceptionally powerful
                magical object, only an exceptionally powerful conjurer could have hoodwinked it.
                Magic way beyond the talents of a fourth year. 
 You seem to have given this a fair bit of thought Mad-Eye. 
 It was once my job to think as dark wizards do Karkaroff perhaps you
                remember? 
 That doesn't help Alastor. Leave this to you Barty. 
 The rules are absolute, the goblet of fire constitutes a binding
                magical contract. Mr Potter has no choice, he is as of tonight... a tri-wizards
                champion. 
 This can't go on Albus. First the dark mark, now this? 
 What do you suggest Minerva? 
 Put an end to it. Don't let Potter compete. 
 You heard Barty the rules are clear. 
 Well the devil with Barty and his rules. And since when did you
                accomodate them... 
 Master I too find it difficult to believe this mere coincidence, if
                we are to truly discover the meaning of these events perhaps we should for the time
                being let them unfold. 
 Do nothing?? Offer him up as bait? Potter is a boy not a piece of
                meat. 
 I agree with Severus. Alastor, keep an eye on Harry will you? 
 I can do that. 
 Don't let him know though, he must be anxious enough as it is...
                knowing what lies ahead. Then again, we all are. 
 How did you do it?
 Never mind. Doesn't matter. You could have let your best friend know
                though. 
 Let you know what? 
 You know bloody well what. 
 I didn't ask for this to happen Ron. Okay? You're being stupid. 
 Yeah that's me, Ron Weasley... Harry Potter's stupid friend. 
 I didn't put my name in that cup. I don't WANT eternal glory I just
                wanna be.. Look, I don't know what happened tonight and I don't know why, it just
                did ok. 
 Piss off. 
 What a charismatic quartet. Hello!
 I'm Rita Skeeter, I write for the daily prophet. But of course you know
                that don't you. It's you we don't know, you're the news. What quirks lurk beneath
                those rosy cheeks? what mysteries do the muscles mask? does courage lie beneath
                those curls? In short, what makes a champion tick. Me, myself and I want to know.
                Not to mention my rabid readers. So, who's feeling up to sharing? Mmm? Shall we
                start with the youngest. Lovely.
 This is cosy. 
 It's a broomcupboard. 
 You should feel right at home then. Don't mind if I use the quill do
                you? 
 Oh, no. 
 So Harry, here you sit, a mere boy of twelve.. 
 I'm fourteen. 
 ...about to compete against three students. Not only vastly more
                emotionally mature than yourself but have mastered spells that you wouldn't attempt
                in your dizziest daydreams. Concerned? 
 I dunno I haven't really thought about it. 
 Course you're not just any ordinary boy of twelve are you... 
 Fourteen. 
 The story's legend. Do you think it was the trauma of your past that
                made you so keen to enter such a dangerous tournament. 
 No I didn't enter. 
 Course you didn't. Everyone loves a rebel Harry. 
 Scratch that last. Speaking of your parents, were they alive, how
                do you think they'd feel? proud? or concerned that your attitude shows at best a
                pathological need for attention, at worst a psychotic deathwish. 

                
 Hey, my eyes aren't glistening with the ghosts
                of my past. 

                
 Harry. I couldn't risk sending Edward. It was since the
                world cup and the ministry's been intercepting more and more owls and she's too
                easily recognised. We need to talk Harry. Face to face. Meet me in the Griffindore
                common room at one o clock this Saturday night and make sure you're alone.
                    P.S....
 AGH! 

                
 The bird bites. 
 Sirius?

                
 Harry Potter aged 12, suspect entrant in the tri-wizard
                tournament. His eyes swimming with the ghosts of his...
 Sirius?! How... 
 I don't have much time Harry so let me get straight to it. Did you or
                did you not put your name into the goblet of fire? 
 No! 
 Shh... I had to ask. Now, tell me about this dream of yours. You
                mentioned Wormtail and Voldemort, but who was the third man in the room? 
 I dunno. 
 You didn't hear a name? 
 No. Umm.. Voldemort was giving him a job to do. Something important. 
 What was that? 
 He wanted... me. I dunno why, but he was gonna use this man to get to
                me. I mean it was only a dream right? 
 Yes. It's just a dream. Look Harry, the deatheaters at the world cup,
                your name rising from that goblet these are not just coincidences. Hogwarts isn't
                safe any more. 
 What are you saying? 
 I'm saying the devils are inside the walls. Igor Karkaroff, he was a
                deatheater. And no one, no one stops being a deatheater. Then there's Barty Crouch,
                heart of stone, sent his OWN son to Azkaban. 
 Do you think one of them put my name in the goblet? 
 I haven't a clue who put your name in that goblet Harry but whoever did
                it is no friend to you. People die in this tournament. 
 I'm not ready for this Sirius. 
 You don't have a choice. 
 Someone's coming! 
 Keep your friends close Harry.
 Who you talking to? 
 Who says I was talking to anyone. 
 I heard voices. 
 Maybe you're imagining things, wouldn't be the first time. 
 You're probably just practicing for your next interview I expect.
 Amazing. Amazing. 
 Neville! You're doing it again! 
 Oh, right sorry. 

                
 Magical water plants of the highland Lochs? 
 Moody gave it to me. That day we had tea.

                
 We've already been through enough people why don't
                you just go and do it yourself? Ughh. What do you want me to say again?
 Ronald would like me to tell you that Seamus told him that Dean was
                told by Parvati that Hagrid was looking for you. 
 Is that right? Well.... what? 
 Uhhh...
 Dean was told by Parvati that... Please don't ask me say it again.
                Hagrid's looking for you. 
 Well you can tell Ronald... 
 I'm NOT an owl! 
 Did you bring your father's cloak like I asked you? 
 Yeah I brought the cloak. Hagrid where are we going? 
 You'll see soon enough. Pay attention this is important. 
 What's with the flower? Hagrid have you combed your hair?
 As a matter of fact I have. You might like to try the same thing now
                and again.
 Hagrid? 
 Oh, the cloak. Put the cloak on.
 Bonsoir Olympe. 
 Oh Hagrid. I thought you weren't coming, I thought perhaps...
                you had... forgotten me. 
 Couldn't forget you Olympe. 
 What is it you want to show me? When we spoke earlier you
                sounded so exhilirated. 
 You'll be glad you came. Trust me.
 Ahh, c'est magnifique!
 Can we get closer? 
 Dragons? That's the first task? You're joking. 
 Come on Harry. They're seriously misunderstood creatures.
 Although, I have to admit that horntail is a right nasty piece of
                work. Poor Ron nearly fainted just seeing him you know. 
 Ron was here? 
 Oh sure. His brother Charlie helped bring him over from Romania.
                Didn't Ron tell you that? 
 No he didn't. He didn't tell me a thing. 
 Cedric rules! 
 Thanks.
 Like the badge? 
 Excuse me..

                
 Can I have a word? 
 Alright.
 Dragons. That's the first task. They've got one for each of us. 
 Are you serious? And Fleur and Krum, do they...? 
 Yes. 
 Right. Hey listen, about the badges. I've asked them not to wear
                them. 
 Don't worry about it.

                
 You're a right foul git you know that? 
 You think so? 
 I know so. 
 Anything else? 
 Yeah. Stay away from me. 
 Fine.
 Why so tense Potter? My father and I have a bet you see. I don't think
                you're gonna last ten minutes in this tournament. He disagrees. He thinks you won't
                last FIVE. 
 I don't give a damn what you or your father thinks Malfoy. He's vile
                and cruel, and you're just pathetic.
 I'll teach you to cast when someone's back is turned. 
 Professor Moody what are you doing? 
 Teaching. 
 Is that a student? 
 Technically it's a ferret.
 My father will hear about this! 
 Is that a threat!
 I could tell you stories about your father that would curl even your
                greasy hair boy! It doesn't end here! 
 We never use transfigration as a punishment, surely Dumbledore
                told you that. 
 He might've mentioned it. 
 Well you will do well to remember it. 

                
 come with me.
 That's a foal glass. Lets me keep an eye on my enemies. If I can see
                the whites of their eyes they're standing right behind me.
 Wouldn't even bother telling you what's in ther. You wouldn't believe
                it if I did. Now... what are you going to do about your dragon? 
 Oh... um... You know I just thought I'd... 
 Sit. Listen to me Potter. Your pal Diggory, by your age he could take
                a whistle into a watch and have it sing you the time. Miss Delacour, she's as much a
                fairy princess as I am. As for Krum, his head may be filled with sawdust but
                Karkaroff's is NOT. They'll have a strategy, and you can bet that it'll play to
                Krum's strengths. Hmm? Come on Potter. What are your strengths? 
 Um... I dunno.. I can fly. I mean I'm a fair flyer. 
 Better than fair the way I heard it. 
 But I'm not allowed a broom. 
 You're allowed a wand.
 Pssst! Harry? Is that you? 
 Yeah. 
 How are you feeling? OK? The key is to concentrate. After that you
                just have to... 
 Battle a dragon.
 Young love! Ohh how.. stirring. If everything goes unfortunately today
                you might make the front page. 

                
 You have no business here. This tent is for champions and
                friends. 
 No matter. We've got what we wanted.
 Good day champions. Gather round please. Now you've waited,
                you've wondered and at last the moment has arrived. The moment only four of you can
                fully appreciate.
 What are you doing here Miss Granger? 
 Oh um.. Sorry I'll just go. 
 Barty. The bag. 
 Champions, in a circle around me. Miss Delacour over here, Mr Krum,
                and Potter over here. Right. Miss Delacour, if you will...
 The welsh green. Mr Krum...
 The chinese fireball. Oooooh.
 The swedish short-snout. Which leaves... 
 The horntail... 
 What's that boy? 
 Nothing.
 The hungarian horntail. These represent very real dragons, each of
                which has been given a golden egg to protect. Your objective is simple, collect the
                egg. This you must do, for each egg contains a clue without which you cannot hope to
                proceed to the next task. Any questions? 
 Very well. Good luck champions. Mr Diggory the sound of the
                    cannon...

                
 Three of our champions have now faced their
                dragons and so each one of them will proceed to the next task. And now our fourth
                and final contestant.
 Your wand harry! Your wand!
 We knew you wouldn't die Harry. 
 Lose a leg. 
 Or an arm. 
 Pack it in altogether. 
 NEVER! 
 Go on Harry, what's the clue?
 Who wants me to open it? You want me to open it?
 What the bloody hell was that?
 Alright everyone, go back to your knitting. This is gonna be
                uncomfortable enough without all you nosey sods listening in. 
 I reckon you'd have to be barking mad to put your own name in the goblet
                of fire. 
 Caught on have you. Took you long enough. 
 Wasn't just me who thought you'd done it. Everyone was saying it behind
                your back. 
 Brilliant. That makes me feel loads better. 
 At least I warned you about the dragons. 
 Hagrid warned me about the dragons. 
 Oh no no, I did. Don't you remember? I told Hermione to tell you that
                Seamus told me that Parvati told Dean that Hagrid was looking for you. Seamus never
                actually told me anything, so it was really me all along. I thought you'd be
                alright, you know, after you figured that out. 
 Who could possibly figure that out? That's completely mental. 
 Yeah it is isn't it. Suppose I was a bit distraught. 
 Boys. 

                
 Look at this! I can't believe it she's done it
                again. Miss Granger a plain but ambitious girl seems to be developing a taste for
                famous wizards. Her latest prey sources report is none other than the Bulgarian
                bon-bon Viktor Krum. No word yet on how Harry Potter's taking this latest emotional
                    blow.
 Parcel for you Mr Weasley. 
 Thank you Nigel.
 Not now Nigel. Later. Go on.
 I told him I'd get him Harry's autograph. Oh look mum's sent me
                something. Mum sent me a dress?? 
 Well it does match your eyes. Is there a bonnet? 
 Ginny these must be for you. 
 I'm not wearing that it's ghastly.
 What are you on about? 
 They're not for Ginny they're for you! Dress robes. 
 Dress robes? for what? 
 The yule ball has been a tradition of the tri-wizard tournament
                since its inception. On Christmas eve night we and our guests gather in the great
                hall for well mannered frivolity. As representitives of the host school I expect
                each and every one of you to put your best foot forward, and I mean this literally
                because the yule ball is first and foremost... a dance.
 Silence. The house of Godrick Griffindore has commanded the
                respect of the wizard world for nearly ten centuries. I will not have you in the
                course of a single evening besmirching that name by behaving like a babbling,
                bumbling band of baboons. 

                
 Try saying that five times faster.

                
 Now to dance is to let the body breathe, inside every girl
                a secret swan slumbers longing to burst forth and take flight. 

                
 Something's about to burst out of Hilary but I
                don't think it's a swan. 
 Inside every boy a lordly lion prepared to prance. Mr Weasly,
                will you join me.
 Now, place your right hand on my waist. 
 Where? 
 My waist.
 Now bend your arm. Mr Filch...
 One two three, one two three, one two three. 

                
 Oi! Never gonna let him forget this are you? 
 Never. 
 Everybody come together.
 Boys, on your feet.
 Why do they always have to travel in packs? How are you supposed to
                get one alone to ask them... 
 Blimey Harry, you slayed dragons. If you can't get a date who can? 
 I think I'd take the dragon right now.
 I take after my mum. Though I didn't know her very well, she left
                when I was about three. No, not the maternal sort her, broke my dad's heart though.
                You know he was a tiny little fellow my dad, I could pick him up with one hand by
                the age of six and put him up in the dresser.
 And then he died when I was still in school. So I had to make me own
                way as it were. But enough of me, what about you! 
 This is mad. At this rate we'll be the only ones in our year without
                    dates.
 Well, us and Neville! 
 But then again he can take himself. 
 It might interest you to know that Neville's already got
                    someone.
 Now I'm really depressed.
 Well Hermione, you're a girl. 
 Oh well spotted. 
 Come on. It's one thing for a bloke to show up alone. For a girl it's
                just sad. 
 I won't be going alone because believe it or not someone's asked
                me. And I said yes. 
 Bloody hell.
 Look. We've just got to grit our teeth and do it. Tonight when we get
                back to the common room, we'll both have partners. Agreed? 
 Agreed. 
 Harry! 
 Cho! 
 Watch yourself on the stairs, it's a bit icey at the top. 
 Ok thanks. Cho? 
 Yes? 
 Um. 
 I just wondered if maybe you wanted to go
                to the ball with me? 
 Sorry? I didn't catch that. 
 Um. I was just wondering if maybe you wanted to go to the ball with
                me. 
 Oh. Um. Harry I'm sorry but someone's already asked me. And well I've
                said I'll go with him. 
 Ok. Great. Fine. No problem. Good. 
 Harry I really am sorry. 
 What happened to you? 
 He just asked Fleur Delacour out. 
 What? 
 What did she say? 
 No of course.
 She said yes?? 
 Don't be silly. 
 There she was walking by. You know I like it when they walk. I couldn't
                help it, it just sort of slipped out. 
 Actually he sort of screamed at her, it was a bit frightening. 
 What did you do then? 
 What else? I ran for it. I'm not cut out for this Harry. I don't know
                what got into me.
 Hi Harry. 
 Hey! 
 Bloody hell.
 What are those?? 
 My dress robes. 
 Well they're alright. No lace, no dodgy little collar. 
 Well I expect yours are more traditional. 
 Traditional?? They're ancient! I look like my great aunt Tessie.
 I smell like my great aunt Tessie. Murder me Harry. 
 Leave it alone. 
 Poor kid, bet she's alone in her room crying her eyes out. 
 Who? 
 Hermione of course. Come on Harry, why'd you think she wouldn't tell us
                who she's coming with? 
 Because we'd take the mickey out of her if she did. 
 Because nobody asked her. I would have taken her myself if she weren't
                so bleeding proud.
 Hello boys. Don't you look...
 ... dashing. 
 Here you are Potter. Are you and Miss Patil ready? 
 Ready professor? 
 To dance. It's traditional that the three champions or in this
                case four are the first to dance. Surely I told you that. 
 No. 
 Oh well now you know. Oh, as for your Mr Weasly you may proceed
                into the great hall with Miss Patil.
 She looks beautiful. 
 Yeah she does.

                
 Is that Hermione Granger? With Viktor Krum?? 
 No. Absolutely not.
 Harry. Take my waist. 
 What? 
 Now.
 Hot isn't it? Viktor's gone to get drinks. Care to join us? 
 No, we'd NOT care to join you and Viktor. 
 What's got your wand in a knot? 
 He's a Durmstrang. You're fraternising with the enemy. 
 The enemy?? Who was it wanting his autograph? Besides, the whole
                point of the tournament is international magical cooperation, to make friends. 
 Hrmph, I think he's got a bit more than friendship on his mind.
 Are you going to ask me to dance or not? 
 No. 

                
 He's using you. 
 How dare you! Besides I can take care of myself. 
 Doubt it. He's way too old. 
 What? What? That's what you think? 
 Yeah that is what I think. 
 You know the solution then don't you. 
 Go on. 
 Next time there's a ball pluck up the courage and ask me before
                somebody else does, and not as a last resort. 
 Well that's completely off the point. Harry...
 Where have you been? Nevermind! Off to bed both of you.
 They get scary when they get older. 
 Ron you spoil everything! 
 Let me see it again.
 Ah yes, the time is close now. Harry! At last! Step aside Wormtail
                so I can give our guest a proper greeting!
 You alright Harry? I just got in. Me!
 Harry you told me you'd figured the egg out weeks ago. The task is
                two days from now. 
 Really? I had no idea. I suppose Viktor's already figured it out. 
 I wouldn't know, we didn't actually talk about the tournament.
                Actually we didn't really talk at all, Viktor's more of a physical being. I just
                mean he's not particularly... Mostly he watches me study. It's a bit annoying
                actually. You are trying to figure this egg out aren't you? 
 What's that supposed to mean? 
 I mean these tasks are supposed to test you, in the most brutal way
                they're almost cruel. And um, I'm scared for you. You got by the dragon mostly on
                nerve, I'm not sure it's going to be enough this time. 
 Hey Potter. 
 Cedric. 
 How are you? 
 Spectacular. 
 Look I realise I never really thanked you properly for tipping me off
                about those dragons. 
 Forget about it. I'm sure you would have done the same for me. 
 Exactly. You know the prefects bathroom on the fifth floor?
 It's not a bad place for a bath. Just take your egg and mull things
                over in the hot water. 
 I must be out of my mind.
 I'd try putting it in the water if I were you. 
 Myrtle! 
 Long time no see.
 I was circling a blocked drain the other day and could swear I saw a
                bit of polyjuice potion. Not being a bad boy again are you Harry? 
 Polyjuice potion! Kicked the habit. Myrtle, did you say try putting it
                in the water?
 Well. That's what he did. The other boy, the handsome one.
                    Cedric.
 Well go on, open it.
 Come seek us where our voices sound. We cannot sing above the
                ground. An hour long you'll have to look, to recover what we took. 
 Myrtle, there aren't Merpeople in the black lake are there? 
 Ahhh, very good. Took Cedric ages to riddle it out. Almost all the
                bubbles were gone...
 Harry, tell me again. 
 Come seek us where our voices sound. 
 The black lake, that's obvious. 
 An hour long you'll have to look. 
 Again obvious, though I must admit potentially problematic 
 Potentially problematic? When was the last time you held your breath
                under the water for an hour Hermione? 
 Look Harry, we can do this. The three of us can figure it
                    out.
 Hate to break up this scholar session but Professor McGonagall would
                like to see you in her office. Not you Potter, just Weasly and Granger. 
 But sir, the second task is only hours away and... 
 Exactly. Presumably Potter is well prepared by now and could do with a
                good night's sleep. Go. Now! Longbottom!
 Why don't you help Potter put his books back. 
 You know, if you're interested in plants you'd be better with
                Gorshok's Guide to Herbology. Do you know there's a wizard in Nepal whose growing
                gravity resistant trees? 
 Neville. No offense, but I really don't care about plants. Now if
                there's a Tibetan turnip that will allow me to breathe underwater for an hour then
                great. 
 I don't know about a turnip but you can always use gilliweed. 
 You're sure about this Neville. 
 Absolutely. 
 For an hour. 
 Most likely. 
 Most likely? 
 Well there is some debate among herbologists as to the effects of
                freshwater versus saltwater. 
 You're telling me this now? You must be joking. 
 I just wanted to help. 
 Well that makes you sight better than Ron and Hermione. Where are they
                anyway? 
 You seem a little tense Harry. 
 Do I? 

                
 Welcome to the second task. Last night something
                was stolen from each of our champions. A treasure of sorts. These four treasures,
                one for each champion, now lie on the bottom of the black lake. In order to win each
                champion need only find their treasure and return to the surface. Simple enough.
                Except for this, they will have one hour to do so and one hour only. After that
                they'll be on their own. 

                
 Put that in your mouth.

                
 You may begin at the start of the cannon.
 What's the matter with him? 
 I don't know I can't see him. 
 Oh my god I've killed Harry Potter!

                
 The Beauxbatons champion Miss Delacour has
                unfortunately been forced to retire. She will take no further part in this task.
            
 But she's my friend too! 
 Only one.
 Harry! 
 Get him another towel. 
 I want all the judges over here now. 

                
 You saved her, even though she wasn't yours to save. My
                little sister!
 Thank you! And you... 
. You helped! 
 Well... yeah... a bit
 Merci.
 Harry! 
 Hermione 
 Are you alright? You must be freezing! Personally I think you
                behaved admirably.
 I finished last Hermione. 
 Next to last. 
 Attention! Attention! The winner is... Mr Diggory!
 For showing unique command of the bubblehead shark. The way I see
                it, Mr Potter would have finished first had it not been for his determination to
                rescue not only Mr Weasly but the others as well. We've agreed to award him second
                place! For outstanding moral fibre.
 All that moral fibre eh? 
 Blimey even when you go wrong it turns out right. 
 Well done 'moral fibre'.
 Congratulations Potter, fine achievement. Well done boy. I'm sorry we
                haven't spoken, after all your story is one I've heard many times. Quite remarkable.
                Tragic of course, to lose one's family. Never whole again are we? Still, life goes
                on. And here we stand. I'm sure your parents would be very proud today
                    Potter.
 Bartimus! Not trying to lure Potter into one of the ministry's summer
                internships are we? Last boy who went into the department of ministries never came
                    out!
 And they say I'm mad. 
 So I remember, I remember when I first met you all. Biggest bunch of
                misfits I've ever set eyes on. Always reminded me of myself a little. And here we
                all are, four years later. 
 We're still misfits. 
 Maybe. But we've all got each other, and Harry of course. Soon to be!
                The youngest! Tri-Wizard champion there's ever been! Hooray!
 Mr Crouch? 
 A man has died here. And he won't be the last, you must take
                action. 
 I will not. In times like these the wizard world looks to its leaders
                for strength Dumbledore. 
 Then for once show them some. 
 The tri-wizard tournament will not be cancelled. I will not be seen as
                a coward. 
 But surely that is what's right, no matter what others think. 
 What did you say? What did you say to me? 
 Excuse me gentlemen, it may interest you to know that this
                conversation is no longer private.
 Harry! Harry how good to see you again. 
 I can come back later Professor. 
 Oh not necessary Harry the minister and I are done. I'll be back
                in a moment. Minister, after you. Harry do feel free to indulge in a liquorice snack
                in my absence, but I have to warn you they're a little bit sharp.
 Agh!
 Professor?
 Professor.
 Igor Karkaroff, you have been brought from Azkaban at your own request
                to present evidence to this counsel. Should your testimony prove consequential.
                Counsel may be prepared to order your immediate release. Until such time you remain
                in the eyes of the ministry a convicted deatheater. Do you accept these terms? 
 I do sir. 
 What do you wish to present? 
 I have names sir. There was a Rosier, Evan Rosier. 
 Mr Rosier is dead. 
 Dead? 

                
 Yeah took a piece of me with him though didn't
                    he.
 I didn't know. 
 If that is all the witness has to offer... 
 No! No! There was Rookwood, he was a spy. 
 Augustus Rookwood? Of the department of ministries. 
 Ya ya, the same. He passed information to you know who from inside the
                ministry itself. 
 Very well. Counsel will deliberate. In the meantime you will be
                returned to Azkaban. 
 NO! WAIT! PLEASE! I have more. Snape, Severus Snape. 
 The counsel is very much aware you have given evidence on this
                matter. Severus Snape was indeed a deatheater and prior to Lord Voldemort's downfall
                turned spy for us at great personal risk. Today he's no more a deatheater than I
                    am.
 It's a lie! Severus Snape remains faithful to the dark lord. 
 Silence!
 Unless the witness possesses any name of genuine consequence this
                session is now concluded. 
 Oh no no no no no. I heard about one more. 
 What's that? 
 The name... 
 Yes? 
 I know for a fact this person took part in the capture, and by means of
                the cruciatus curse, torture of the aurer Frank Longbottom and... 
 The name! Give me the wretched name! 
 Barty Crouch! ... Junior.
 Get your hands off me you pathetic little men. Hello father. 
 You are no son of mine. 
 GAHHHH!
 Curiosity's not a sin Harry, but you should exercise caution.
                It's a pensieve, useful if like me you find your mind a wee bit stretched. It allows
                me to see what small things I've already seen. You see Harry I've searched and
                searched for something, some small detail. Something I might have overlooked,
                something that would explain why these terrible things have happened. Every time I
                get close to an answer it slips away, it's maddedning. 
 Sir, Mr Crouch's son, what happened to him? 
 He was sent to Azkaban. Destroyed Barty to do it. But he had no
                choice, the evidence was overwhelming. Why do you ask? 
 It's just that I had a dream about him. It was in the summer, before
                school. In the dream I was in a house and Voldemort was there only he wasn't quite
                human, and Wormtail was there too and Mr Crouch's son. 
 Have there been other dreams like this? 
 Yes. Always the same one. Sir... these dreams, what I see, you don't
                think it's actually happening do you? 
 I think it's unwise for you to linger over these dreams Harry, I
                think it's best that you simply...
 Cast them away. 
 It's a sign Severus, you know what it means as well as I.
 Potter! What's your hurry? Congratulations, your performance in the
                black lake was inspiring. Gilliweed, am I correct? 
 Yes sir. 
 Ingenious. A rather rare herb gilliweed, not something found in your
                every day garden. Nor is this, know what it is? 
 Bubble juice sir? 
 Veritaserum. Three drops of this and you-know-who himself will spill
                his darkest secrets. The use of this on a student is regrettably forbidden, however
                should you ever steal from my personal stores again, my hand might just slip over
                your morning pumpkin juice. 
 I haven't stolen anything. 
 Don't lie to me. Gilliweed might be innocuous, but boomslang skin?
                lacewing flies? You and your friends are brewing polyjuice potion and believe me I'm
                going to find out why.
 Earlier today Professor Moody placed the tri-wizards cup deep
                within the maze. Only he knows its exact position. Now as Mr Diggory...

                
 and Mr Potter tied for first position they will be the
                first to enter the maze. Followed by Mr Krum...

                
 The first person to touch the cup will be the winner. I've
                instructed the staff to patrol the perimeter, if at any point should a contestant
                wish to withdraw from the task he or she need only send up red sparks with their
                wands. Contestants, gather round. 

                
 In the maze you'll find not dragons or creatures
                of the deep. Instead you'll face something more challenging. You see, people change
                in the maze. Oh find the cup if you can, but be very weary you could just lose
                yourselves along the way. 
 Champions! Prepare yourselves.
 On the count of three... ONE...
 Fleur? Fleur!
 Get down!
 No stop! He's bewitched Cedric.
 Get off me! 
 He's bewitched!
 Harry! Harry!
 You know for a moment there I thought you were gonna let it get me. 
 For a moment so did I. 
 Some game huh? 
 Some game.
 Go. Take it, you saved me! 
 Together, on three. One, two, three! 
 You ok? 
 Yeah, you? 
 Where are we? 
 I've been here before. 
 It's a portkey. Harry the cup is a portkey. 
 I've been here before in a dream. Cedric, we have to get back to the
                cup? Now! 
 What are you talking about?
 What is it? 
 Get back to the cup!
 Who are you? What do you want? 
 Kill the spare.
 Cedric!
 Do it, now!
 Bones of the father, unwillingly given.
 Flesh of the servent willingly sacrificed.
 Blood of the enemy forcibly taken.
 The dark lord shall rise again.
 My wand Wormtail.
 Hold out your arm. 
 Master. Thank you master. 
 The other arm Wormtail.
 Welcome my friends. Thirty years it's been, and yet you stand
                before me as though it were only yesterday. I confess myself disappointed, not one
                of you tried to find me.
 Not even you, Lucius. 
 My lord. Had I detected any sign or even a whisper of your
                whereabouts. 
 There were signs my friend, and more than whispers. 
 I assure you I never renounced the old ways. The face I have
                been obliged to present each day since your absence, that was my true mask. 
 I returned. 
 Out of fear, not loyalty. Still you have proved yourself useful
                these past few months Wormtail.
 Thank you master, thank you. 

                
 Oh, such a handsome boy. 
 Don't touch him.
 Harry! I'd almost forgotten you were here. Standing on the bones
                of my father. I'd introduce you but word has it you're almost as famous as me these
                days. The boy who lived. How lies have fed your legend Harry. Shall I reveal what
                really happened that night thirteen years ago? Shall I divulge how I truly lost my
                powers? It was love. You see when dear sweet Lily Potter gave her life for her only
                son she provided the ultimate protection. I could not touch you. It was old magic,
                something I should have forseen. But no matter, no matter. Things have changed, I
                can touch you now!
 Astonishing what a few drops of your blood will do eh Harry? Pick
                up your wand Potter. I said pick it up, get up. Get up! You've been taught how to
                duel I presume yes? First we bow to each other. Come on now Harry the niceties must
                be observed, Dumbledore would not want you to forget your manners now would he? I
                said bow!
 That's better. And now...
 Atta boy Harry, your parents would be proud. Especially your
                filthy mongrel mother. I'm going to kill you Harry Potter, I'm going to destroy you.
                After tonight no one will ever again question my powers. After tonight if they speak
                of you they'll speak only of how you begged for death, and I being a merciful lord
                obliged. Get up.
 Don't you turn your back on me Harry Potter I want you to look at
                me when I kill you, I want to see the lights leave your eyes.
 Have it your way.
 Do nothing. He is mine to finish. He's mine!

                
 Harry when the connection is broken you must get to the
                portkey. We can delay it for a moment to give you time but only a moment, do you
                understand? 

                
 Harry take my body back will you? Take my body back to my
                father. 

                
 Let go. Sweetheart you're ready. Let go! Let go!
 No! 
 Harry! Harry!
 Tell me what happened! 
 He's back, he's back! Voldemort's back. Cedric, he asked me to bring
                his body back. I couldn't leave him, not there. 
 It's alright Harry. It's alright, he's home, you both are. 
 Keep everybody in their seats. A boy has just been killed. The body
                must be moved Dumbledore, there are... too many people. 
 Let me through! That's my son! My boy!
 Are you alright Potter?
 Does it hurt? 
 Not so much now. 
 I'd better take a look at it.
 The cup was a portkey. Someone had bewitched it. 
 What was it like? What was he like? 
 Who? 
 The dark lord. What was it like to stand in his presence? 
 I dunno. It was like I'd fallen into one of my dreams. One of my
                    nightmares.
 Were there others? In the graveyard, were there others? 
 Um. I don't think I said anything about a graveyard Professor. 
 Marvellous creatures dragons aren't they? Do you think that miserable
                oaf would have led you into the woods if I hadn't suggested it? Do you think Cedric
                Diggory would have told you to hold the egg under the water if I hadn't have told
                him first myself? Do you think Neville Longbottom the witless wonder could have
                provided you with gilliweed if I hadn't have given him the book that led you
                straight to it? Huh?? 
 It was you from the beginning. You put my name in the goblet of fire.
                You bewitched Krum. But...
 You won because I made it so Potter. You ended up in that graveyard
                tonight because it was meant to be so. And now the deed is done. The blood that runs
                through these veins runs within the dark lord. Imagine how he will reward me when he
                learns that I have once and for all silenced the great Harry Potter.
 Severus...
 Do you know who I am? 
 Albus Dumbledore. 
 Are you Alastor Moody? Are ya? 
 No. 
 Is he in this room? Is he in this room?
 Harry get away from there!
 Are you alright Alastor? 
 I'm sorry Albus. 
 That's Moody, but then who's...?
 Polyjuice potion. 
 Now we know who's been stealing it from your store
                    Severus.
 We'll get you up in a minute.
 Barty Crouch Junior. 
 I'll show you mine if you show me yours.
 Your arm Harry. 
 You know what this means don't you? He's back. Lord Voldemort has
                returned. 
 Send an owl to Azkaban, think they'll find they're missing a
                prisoner. 
 I'll be welcomed back like a hero. 
 Perhaps. Personally I've never had much time for heroes. 

                
 Today we acknowledge a really terrible loss.
                Cedric Diggory was as you all know, exceptionally hard working, intricately fair
                minded. And most importantly a fierce fierce friend. I think therefore you have the
                right to know exactly how he died. You see, Cedric Diggory was murdered by Lord
                Voldemort. The ministry of magic does not wish me to tell you this. But not to do so
                I think would be an insult to his memory. Now the pain we all feel at this dreadful
                loss reminds me, reminds us that while we may come from different places and speak
                in different tongues, our hearts beat as one. In light of recent events the bonds of
                friendship we made this year will be more important than ever. Remember that and
                Cedric Diggory will not have died in vain, you remember that. And we'll celebrate a
                boy who was kind and honest and brave and true right to the very end. 
 I never liked these curtains. Set them on fire in my fourth year,
                by accident of course. I put you in terrible danger this year Harry I'm sorry. 
 Professor, when I was in the graveyard there was a moment... um...
                when Voldemort's wand and mine sort of connected. 
 Priori Incantatem. You saw your parents that night didn't you?
                They reappeared.
 No spell can reawaken the dead Harry I trust you know that. Dark
                and diffiult times lie ahead. Soon we must all face the choice between what is right
                what is easy. But remember this, you have friends here. You're not alone. 
 Write to me. Promise. 
 Bye.
 Au revoir Ron.
 Do you think we'll ever just have a quiet year at Hogwarts? 
 No. 
 No I don't think so. 
 Everything's going to change now isn't it? 
 Yes. 
 Promise you'll write this summer. Both of you. 
 Well I won't. You know I won't! 
 Harry will won't you? 
 Yeah. Every week.
 I can't, Hedwig. I'm not allowed to use magic outside of school. Besides, if
      Uncle Vernon -- At the sound of the name, HEDWIG SQUAWKS again, LOUDER. 

      
 Har-ry Pot-ter! 
 Now you've done it. 
 I warned you. If you can't control that bloody bird, it'll have to go. 
 She's bored. If I could just let her out for an hour or two -- 
 And have you sending secret messages to your freaky little friends? No,
      sir. 
 But I haven't gotten any messages. From any of my friends. Not one. All
      summer. 
 Who'd want to be friends with you? 
 I should think you'd be more grateful. We raise you since you were a
      baby, give you food off our table, even let you have Dudley's second bedroom... purely out of
      the goodness of our hearts. 
 I thought he got the second bedroom because Mum was afraid he'd turn us into
      dung beetles if you put him back in the cupboard under the stairs. 

    
 Not yet, popkin. That's for when the Masons arrive. 
 Which should be any moment. Now. Let's run through our schedule one more
      time. Petunia, when the Masons get here, you will be -- 
 In the lounge, waiting to welcome them graciously to our home. 
 Good. And Dudley? 
 I'll be waiting to open the door. 
 Excellent. 
 And you? 
 I'll be in my bedroom, making no noise and pretending I don't exist. 
 Too right you will. With any luck, this could well be the day I make the
      biggest deal of my career. 

    
 Upstairs! Hurry! 
 Harry Potter! Such an honor it is! 
 What... Who are you? 
 Dobby, sir. Dobby the house elf. 
 I see. Not to be rude or anything, but this isn't a great time for me to have
      a house-elf in my bedroom. 
 Oh, yes, sir, Dobby understands. It's just that, Dobby has come to tell you...
      it is difficult, sir... Dobby wonders where to begin. 
 Why don't you sit down? 
 S-s-sit down? 

    
 Shhhh! I'm sorry. I didn't mean to offend you or anything -- 
 Offend Dobby! Dobby has heard of your greatness, sir, but never has he been
      asked to sit down by a wizard, like an equal... 
 You can't have met many decent wizards then. Dobby shakes his head, then
      without warning, LEAPS off the bed and starts to BANG HIS HEAD FURIOUSLY ON THE FLOOR. 
 Bad Dobby! Bad Dobby! 
 Don't mind that. It's just the... cat. 
 Cat? What cat? 
 Our cat, tiger. 
 Are you... all right? 
 Dobby had to punish himself, sir. Dobby almost spoke ill of his family, sir. 
 Your... family? 
 The wizard family Dobby serves, sir. Dobby is bound to serve one family
      forever. If they ever knew Dobby was here... Dobby shudders in fear, then looks up, WHISPERS
      urgently. 
 But Dobby had to come. Dobby has to protect Harry Potter. To warn him.
        
 Harry Potter must not go back to Hogwarts School of
      Witchcraft and Wizardry this year. 
 Not go back? But... I have to. 
 This is a plot. A plot to make most terrible things happen. If Harry Potter
      goes back to school he will be in great danger. 
 What terrible things? Who's plotting them? Dobby makes a funny CHOKING and
      GAGGING noise. 
 Okay! I understand. You can't say -- Too late. Dobby grabs the bedside lamp
      and starts beating himself about the head and YELPING LOUDLY. 
 They arrive at the ninth hole and -- DOBBY'S YELPS INTERRUPT, ringing
      out from above. 
 Sounds as if that cat of yours has dragged something in with it, Dursley. 
 Not to worry. I'll sort it out. 
 Stop! Stop! FOOTSTEPS THUNDER on the landing. Quickly, Harry grabs Dobby by
      the pillowcase and pitches him into the wardrobe... just as the door FLINGS OPEN. 
 What the devil are you doing up here! You've just ruined the punch line
      of my Japanese golfer joke. One more sound and you'll wish you'd never been born, boy! He
      stomps flat-footed from the room and SLAMS THE DOOR. Harry lets Dobby out of the wardrobe. 
 See why I've got to go back? I don't belong here. I belong in your world -- at
      Hogwarts. It's the only place I've got... friends. 
 Friends who don't even write to Harry Potter? 
 Well, I expect they've been -- hang on, how do you know my friends haven't
      been writing me? Guiltily, Dobby takes out a STACK of LETTERS. 
 Harry Potter mustn't be angry with Dobby -- Dobby hoped if Harry Potter
      thought his friends had forgotten him... Harry Potter might not want to go back to school,
      sir... 
 Give me those. Now. Dobby frowns sadly, then DASHES out the door. Panicking...
    
 Dobby... Please... No... 
 Harry Potter must say he's not going back to school. 
 I can't. Hogwarts is my home. 

      
 Then Dobby must do it, sir. For Harry Potter's own good.
      Dobby SNAPS HIS FINGERS. The pudding PLUMMETS... straight onto the Masons. They stand
      blinking, covered head to foot with whipped cream and sugared violets. The Masons exit. Uncle
      Vernon and Aunt Petunia race after them. 
 I'm sorry. It's our nephew. Very disturbed. Meeting strangers upsets
      him, so we kept him upstairs... 
 We have ice cream... The Masons get into their car and drive off, just
      as a SHRIEKING SOUND splits the sky. An OWL SWOOPS down, and DROPS a LETTER at Uncle Vernon's
      feet. He picks up the letter, opens it. As he reads it, a mad gleam dances in Uncle Vernon's
      eye. He turns and races back inside the house. Aunt Petunia follows. 
 Go on. Read it. 
 'Dear Mr. Potter. We have received intelligence that a Hover Charm was used at
      your place of residence at twelve minutes past seven this evening. As you know, underage
      wizards...' 
 '... are not permitted to perform spells outside school.' 

      
 You didn't tell us you weren't Allowed to use magic at
      home. Slipped your mind, didn't it? 
 Well, I've got news for you, boy. I'm locking you up! And if you try to
      magic yourself out, they'll expel you! You're never going back to that school! Never! 
 I know what day it is. 
 Well done, Dudley. Finally learned the days of the week, have you. 
 Today's your birthday. And nobody cares. Dudley SNAPS SHUT the flap. Harry
      sighs, takes the soup and a bit of stale bread, and crosses to Hedwig. 
 It's no good turning your beak up. It's all we've got. Harry feeds a piece of
      bread to Hedwig... as we... 

    
 Ron? 
 Hiya, Harry. 
 Fred? George? What're you doing here? 
 Rescuing you, of course. Where's your trunk? 
 Stand back.
 Hedwig! Harry clambers back, grabs Hedwig's cage, swings it onto the ledge,
      when... BAM! The bedroom door CRASHES OPEN. 
 Petunia! He's getting away! 

      

    
 Hold on, Harry! 
 Oh no, boy! You and that bloody pigeon aren't going anywhere!
        

    
 Put your foot down, Fred! 

    
 By the way, Harry. Happy Birthday. 

    
 Hurry! Let's nip inside before Mum wakes up! 
 It's not much. 
 I think it's... brilliant! Ron looks up. Sees Harry's mesmerized face.
      Slowly...GRINS. 

      
 WHERE... HAVE... YOU... BEEN?! 

    
 Harry! How wonderful to see you. 
 Beds
      empty! No note! You could've died! You could've been seen! 
 I
      don't blame you, of course, dear. 
 They were starving him, Mum! There were bars on his window! 
 You best hope I don't put bars on your window, Ronald Weasley!
        
 Care for a spot of tea, Harry? 
 Mummy. Have you seen my jumper -- 

    
 Ginny. Been talking about you all summer. Dead annoying, really. 
 Dad's home! 

    
 What a night! Nine raids! Nine! 

      
 Raids? 
 Dad works at the Ministry of Magic. In the Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office. 
 The Misuse of Muggle Artefacts...? 
 That's when wizards bewitch something to drive Muggles mad. Shrinking door keys,
      that kind of thing. Dad loves Muggles. Thinks they're fascinating. 

    
 Well now. Who are you? 
 Harry, sir. Harry Potter. 
 Good Lord, are you really? Ron's told us all about you, of course. When
      did you get here? 

      
 This morning. Your sons flew that enchanted car of yours to Surrey house
      and back last night. 
 Did you now! How'd it go?! 
 I... I
      mean... That was very wrong, boys. Very wrong indeed. So, Harry. You must know all about
      Muggles. Tell me, what exactly is the function of a parking meter? 

    
 That must be Errol with the post. Fetch him, will you, George?
        

    
 It's our Hogwarts letters! And look. They've sent Harry's as well. 
 Dumbledore must know you're here, Harry. Doesn't miss a trick, that man. 

      
 This lot won't come cheap, Mum. The spellbooks alone... 
 We'll manage. Right then. There's only one place to get all of this. 
 Diagon Alley! 
 You first, Harry dear. 

    
 Harry's never traveled by Floo Powder before, Mum. 
 Floo Powder? Just then, Ron's older brother PERCY enters. 
 Percy. Would you mind going first, so Harry can see how it's done? 
 Certainly, Mother. Don't worry, Harry. It's simple enough. 

    
 Diagon Alley. 

    
 Remember to speak clearly, dear! 
 And mind you get out at the right grate! 

      
 D-Dia-gon Alley! 
 Mr. Malfoy! What a pleasure to see you again. If I may, just in today -- 
 I'm not buying today, Mr. Borgin. But selling. 
 Selling? 
 You have heard, of course, that the Ministry of Magic is conducting
      more raids. There are even rumors of a new Muggle Protection Act... 

    
 I have a few... ah... items at home that might prove embarrassing if
      the Ministry were to call. Certain poisons and the like... 
 Hmmm... yes. I see... 

    
 Can I have this? 
 Ah, the Hand of Glory. Insert a candle and it gives light only to the
      holder. Best friend of thieves and plunderers. Your son has fine taste, sir. 
 Hopefully my son will amount to more than a thief, Mr. Borgin. Though
      if his marks don't pick up -- 
 It's not my fault the teachers have favorites. That Hermione Granger -- 
 I would have thought you'd be ashamed that a girl of no wizarding
      family beat you in every exam. 
 It's the same all over. Wizard blood is counting for less everywhere. 
 Not with me. 

    
 Very good. I'll expect you at the manor tomorrow. Come, Draco.
        

    

      
 Not lost are you, my dear? 

    
 I'm fine, thanks. I'm just -- 
 HARRY! What d'yer think yer doin' down 'ere? 
 Hagrid! 

    
 Yer a mess! Skulkin' 'round Knockturn Alley. Dodgy place, Harry. Don't want
      no one ter see yeh down there. People'll be thinkin' yer up ter no good. 
 I was lost, I -- Hang on. What were you doing down there? 
 I was lookin' fer a Flesh Eatin' Slug Repellent. They're ruinin' the school
      cabbages. 

      
 Harry! 

    
 Hello, Hagrid. Oh, it's wonderful to see you two again. 

    
 Oculus Reparo. Instantly, Harry's glasses are mended. 
 I need to remember that one. 
 C'mon. Everyone's been so worried. 

    
 So you're dentists! Fascinating! I understand other Muggles quite fear
      you? Why is that? 
 Oh, Harry. Thank goodness. We hoped you'd only gone one grate too far.
      Come now. We're off to Flourish and Blotts. 
 Isn't it thrilling! Gilderoy Lockhart's going to be there! We can actually
      meet him! I mean, he's written almost the whole booklist! 

    
 Who? 
 There he is! 
 Mum fancies him. 

      

    
 Out of the way! This is for The Daily Prophet! 

    
 It can't be Harry Potter? 

    

      
 Nice big smile, Harry. Together, you and I rate the front
      page. 
 Ladies and gentlemen! What an extraordinary moment
      this is! When young Harry here stepped into Flourish and Blotts this morning to purchase my
      autobiography, Magical Me -- which, incidentally is celebrating its twenty-seventh week atop
      The Daily Prophet's Bestseller List -- he had no idea that he would, in fact, be leaving with
      my entire collected works! Free of charge! 

    
 Thank you. 

    
 You have these. I'll buy my own -- 

      
 Bet you loved that, didn't you, Potter? Famous Harry Potter.
      Can't even go into a bookshop without making the front page. 
 Leave him alone! He didn't want all that! 
 Look, Potter. You've got yourself a girlfriend! 
 Silence, Draco! Ah... Mr. Potter. I don't believe we've met.
        

    
 Forgive me, Mr. Potter. But your scar is legend. As, of course, is the
      wizard who gave it to you. 
 He was a murderer. 
 Yes, a pity about your parents. Curious that you yourself should escape
      with a mere flesh wound. Curious, too, that you speak of him in the past. Surely, you don't
      think He-Who-Must-Not-Be- Named is gone forever. 
 His name is Voldemort. 

    
 You must be very brave, Mr. Potter, to dare speak his name. Or foolish. 
 Fear of a name only increases fear of the thing itself. 

    
 You must be Miss Granger. Draco's told me all about you... and your
      parents. Muggles, aren't you? 

    
 Ron! Harry! It's mad in here. Let's go outside. 
 Well, well, well -- Arthur Weasley. 

      
 Lucius. 
 Busy time at the Ministry. All those raids. I hope they're paying you
      overtime. 

    
 Obviously not. Dear me. What's the use of being a disgrace to the name
      of wizard if they don't even pay you well for it. 
 We have a very different idea about what disgraces the name of wizard,
      Lucius. 

      
 Clearly. The company you keep, Weasley. And I thought
      your family could sink no lower. 

    
 Ignore 'im, Arthur. 

    
 Here, girl. Take your book. It's the best your father can give you.
        

    
 No Malfoy's worth listenin' ter. Rotten ter the core, the whole family...
        

    
 Oh dear! The train'll be leaving any moment! All together now!
        

    
 Go on, Ginny. You know what to do. 

    

      
 Come, Ginny. We'll get you a seat. 
 We better hurry. 

    
 What in blazes d'you two think you're doing? 
 Sorry. Lost control of the trolley. 
 Why can't we get
      through? 
 I dunno. The gateway's sealed itself for some reason. 

    
 The train leaves at exactly eleven o'clock. We've missed it. 
 Can't hear a thing. 
 Harry. If we can't get
      through, maybe Mum and Dad can't get back. 
 Maybe we should go wait by the car. 
 The car! 
 This is mad. We can't drive to Hogwarts. 
 Who says we're driving? 
 You don't mean -- Ron, no. 
 Look, who knows when Mum and Dad will get back. And we've got to get to school,
      haven't we? And even underage wizards are allowed to use magic if it's an absolute emergency.
      Least that's what Fred and George always say... 
 Something tells me we're going to regret this. 
 No offense, Ron, but are you sure you know how to fly this. 
 No problem. 

    
 There. See. Now I reckon all we have to do is find the Hogwarts Express and
      follow it. Simple. 

    
 Uh, Ron. I should tell you. Most Muggles aren't accustomed to seeing a flying
      car. 
 Right. 

    
 Uh oh. The Invisibility Booster must be faulty. 

    
 Any sign of the train? 
 There! Up ahead! Look... 

    
 Brilliant. 

    
 It must be around here someplace. 

    
 Do you hear that? 

    
 Aaaahhhhh! 

    
 Take my hand! 

    
 Hold on! 
 I'm trying! Your hand's all sweaty! 

    
 I think we found the train. 
 Welcome home, Harry. 

    
 Just out of interest, Ron. Have you ever landed a car before? 
 Well... no. but, until a few hours ago, I'd never taken off in one either.
        

    
 Uh oh. 

    
 IT'S NOT WORKING! 
 UP! UP! 

    
 MIND THAT TREE! 

    
 TURN! TURN! 

    
 STOP! STOP! STOP! 

    
 My wand! Look at my wand! 
 Be thankful it's not your neck. 

    
 What's happening? 

    
 Aaaaahhhhh! 

    
 What kind of tree is this? 

    
 Aaaaahhhhh! 

      

    
 Reverse! Reverse! 

    
 Dad's going to kill me. 

    
 A house elf shows up in my bedroom, we can't get through the barrier to
      Platform Nine and Three Quarters, we almost get killed by a tree... clearly someone doesn't
      want me here this year. 
 Well, take a good look, lads... 

    
 This night might well be the last you spend in this castle. 
 You were seen! By no less then seven Muggles. Do you have any idea how serious
      this is? You have risked the exposure of our world. Not to mention the damage you inflicted on
      a Whomping Willow that has been on these grounds for hundreds of years. 
 Honestly, Professor Snape, I think it did more damage to us. 
 Silence! I assure you, were you in Slytherin and your fate rested with me, the
      both of you would be on the train home tonight. As it is -- 
 They are not. 

    
 Professor Dumbledore. Professor McGonagall... 
 Headmaster, these boys have flouted the Decree for the Restriction of Underage
      Wizardry. As such... 
 I'm well aware of our bylaws, Severus, having written more than a
      few myself. However, as Head of Gryffindor House, it is for Professor McGonagall to determine
      the appropriate action. 

      
 We'll go and get our stuff. 
 What are you talking about, Mr. Weasley? 
 Well, you're going to expel us, aren't you? 
 Not today, Mr. Weasley. But I must impress upon both of you the
      seriousness of what you have done. I will be sending owls to both of your families tonight.
      And you will each get a detention. 

    
 Splendid. Now, I suggest we return to the feast. There's a
      delicious-looking custard tart I want to sample. 

    
 Mr. Filch. You dropped this... 

    
 Detention. On the first day? 
 That must be some kind of record. 
 I should think you'd count yourself lucky that's all you got. 
 I should think you'd mind your own business. 

    
 Welcome to Greenhouse Three, Second Years. Today, we will be re-potting
      Mandrakes. Now, who here can tell me the properties of the Mandrake? Yes, Miss Granger. 
 Mandrake, or Mandragora, is used to return those who have been transfigured
      to their original state. It's also quite dangerous. The Mandrake's cry is fatal to anyone who
      hears it. 
 Excellent. Ten points to Gryffindor. As our Mandrakes are only seedlings,
      their cries won't kill yet. However, they will knock you out for several hours. That is why I
      have provided each of you with a pair of earmuffs. If you would then... 

    
 Hm. Looks as though Mr. Longbottom neglected his muffs. 
 No, ma'am. He's just fainted. 
 Very well. We'll just leave him then. Come now. Four to a tray, plenty of
      pots to go round... 
 There's Nearly Headless Nick. 
 Hello, Sir Nicolas. 
 Hello, Percy. Miss Clearwater. 

    
 Say it. I'm doomed. 
 You're doomed. 

    
 Hiya, Harry. I'm Colin Creevey. I'm in Gryffindor too. 
 Hello, Colin. Nice to meet -- 
 They're for my dad -- the pictures. He's a milkman, you know, a Muggle, like
      all our family's been until me. No one knew all the odd stuff I could do was magic till we got
      my letter from Hogwarts. Everyone just thought I was mental. 
 Imagine that. 
 Say, Harry. D'you think your friend could take a photo of me and you standing
      together? Ya' know, to prove I've met you? 

    
 Post is here! 

    
 Bloody bird's a menace -- Oh... no. 
 Heads up, everyone. Weasley's gotten himself a Howler. 
 Go on, Ron. I ignored one from my Gran once... and it was horrible.
        

    

      
 RONALD WEASLEY! HOW DARE YOU STEAL THAT CAR! I AM ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTED!
      YOUR FATHER'S NOW FACING AN INQUIRY AT WORK AND IT'S ENTIRELY YOUR FAULT! IF YOU PUT ANOTHER
      TOE OUT OF LINE WE'LL BRING YOU STRAIGHT HOME! 
 Oh, and Ginny
      dear. Congratulations on making Gryffindor. Your father and I are so proud. 

    
 Look at it this way. How much worse can things get? 
 Let me introduce you to your new Defense Against the Dark Arts
      Teacher. Me. Gilderoy Lockhart, Order of Merlin, Third Class, Honorary Member of the Dark
      Force Defense League and five times winner of Witch Weekly's Most- Charming-Smile Award -- But
      I don't talk about that. I didn't get rid of the Bandon Banshee by smiling at her!
        

    
 I see you've all bought a complete set of my books. Well done. I
      thought we'd start today with a little quiz. Nothing to worry about. Just to check how well
      you've read them, how much you've taken in... 

    
 Look at these questions. They're all about him. 
 'What is Gilderoy Lockhart's favorite color?' 
 'What is Gilderoy Lockhart's greatest achievement to date?' 
 'When is Gilderoy Lockhart's birthday and what would his ideal gift be?' 
 You have thirty minutes. Start -- now! 

    
 Tut, tut. Hardly any of you remembered my favorite color is lilac.
      But Miss Hermione Granger knew that my secret ambition is to rid the world of evil and market
      my own range of hair care potions. Good girl. 

    
 Now... be warned! It is my job to arm you against the foulest
      creatures known to wizardkind! You may find yourself facing your own worst fears in this room.
      Know only that no harm can befall you whilst I am here... 

    
 I must ask you not to scream. It might provoke them. 

    
 Cornish pixies? 
 Freshly caught Cornish pixies. 

    
 Laugh if you will, Mr. Finnegan, but pixies can be devilishly
      tricky little blighters. Let's see what you make of them now! 

    
 Come on now, round them up, round them up. They're only pixies.
        
 Peskipiski Pesternomi! 

    
 I'll ask you three to just nip the rest of them back into their
      cage. 

    
 What do we do now? 

      
 Immobilus! 

    
 Why is it always me? 
 Can you believe him? 
 I'm sure Professor Lockhart just wanted to give us some hands-on
      experience. 
 Hands on? Hermione, he didn't have a clue what he was doing. 
 Rubbish. Read his books. You'll see all the amazing things he's done. 
 He says he's done. 
 I spent the summer devising a whole new Quidditch program. We're going to train
      earlier, harder, and longer! 
 What the... I don't believe it!
        

    
 Uh-oh. I smell trouble. 
 Clear out, Flint! I booked the pitch for Gryffindor today. 
 Easy, Wood. I've got a note. 

    
 'I, Professor Severus Snape, do hereby give the Slytherin team permission to
      practice today, owing to the need to train their new Seeker.' 
 You've
      got a new Seeker? Who? 

    
 Draco? 
 That's right. And that's not all that's new this year... 

    
 Those are Nimbus Two Thousand Ones. 
 A generous gift from Draco's father. 
 That's right, Weasley. You see, unlike some, my father can afford to buy the
      best. 
 At least no one on the Gryffindor team had to buy their way in. They got in
      on pure talent. 
 No one asked your opinion, you filthy little Mudblood. 

    
 Save it for the match. 
 You'll pay for that one, Malfoy! 
 Eat slugs!
        

    
 Ron! Say something! 

    
 Wow! Can you hold him still, Harry?! 
 Get out of the way, Colin! 
 Let's take him to
      Hagrid. He'll know what to do. 
 Got jus' the thing. Set 'im down on that chair o'er there. 

    
 Better out than in. Who was he tryin' ter curse anyway? 
 Malfoy. He called Hermione, well, I don't know exactly what it means... 

      
 He called me a Mudblood. 
 He didn'! 

    
 It means dirty blood. Mudblood's a really foul name for someone who was
      Muggle-born. Someone with non-magic parents. Someone...like me. It's not a term one usually
      hears in civilized conversation. 
 Yeh see, Harry. There are some wizards -- like Malfoy's family -- who think
      they're better than everyone else 'cause they're what people call pureblood. 
 That's horrible. 

      
 It's disgusting! 
 An' it's codswallop ter boot. Dirty blood. There's 'ardly a wizard today
      that's not half-blood or less. If we 'adn't married Muggles we'd've died out long ago.
      Besides, they haven't invented a spell our Hermione can't do... 
 Don' you think on it, Hermione. Don' you think on it fer a minute. 
 Harry, Harry, Harry... Can you possibly imagine a better way to
      serve detention than by helping me answer my fan mail? 

    
 Fame's a fickle friend, Harry. Celebrity is as celebrity does.
      Remember that. 

    
 Come... come to me... 
 What? 
 I was saying, six solid months at the top of the bestseller list!
      Broke all records! 
 No... not you, that... voice. 
 Voice? 
 That... voice. Didn't you hear it? 
 What are you talking about, Harry? I think we're getting a bit
      drowsy. Great Scott -- and no wonder -- look at the time! We've been here nearly four hours!
      Dinner's nearly done! If you hurry you might make pudding. Spooky how the time flies when
      one's having fun! 
 Spooky. 
 Blood... I smell blood... 

    
 Let me rip you... let me kill you... 

    
 Harry! 
 Did you hear it? 
 Hear what? 
 That... voice. 
 Voice? What voice? 

      
 I heard it first in Lockhart's office and then again, just
      -- 
 Kill... Time to kill... 

    
 It's moving. I think it's going to... kill. 

    
 Harry, what are you doing? 

    
 'The Chamber of Secrets has been opened...?' 
 What's that? Hanging underneath? 
 That's Filch's cat. Mrs. Norris. 

    
 Look at that. Have you ever seen spiders act like that? Ron...? 

      
 I... don't... like... spiders. 

    
 Enemies of the heir, beware! You'll be next, Mudbloods! 

    
 What's going on here? Go on now! Make way...
 Mrs.
      Norris! 
 You! You've murdered my cat! I'll kill you! I'll -- 
 Argus! 

    
 Everyone will proceed to their dormitories immediately. 
 Everyone except you three. 

    
 It was definitely a curse that killed her -- probably the
      Transmogrifian Torture. Encountered it myself once, in Ouagadougou. The full story's in my
      autobiography... 
 She's not dead, Argus. She's been Petrified. 
 Precisely! So unlucky I wasn't there. I know the very countercurse
      that could have spared her... 
 But how she's been Petrified... I cannot say. 

      
 Ask him! It's him that's done it. You saw what he wrote on
      the wall! Besides, he knows I'm -- I'm a Squib. 
 It's not true, sir! I swear! I never touched Mrs. Norris -- And I don't even
      know what a Squib is. 
 Rubbish! He saw my Kwikspell letter! 
 If I might, Headmaster...The others turn, watch Snape separate from the
      shadows. 
 Perhaps Potter and his friends were simply in the wrong place at the wrong
      time... 

    
 However, the circumstances are suspicious. I, for one, don't recall seeing
      Potter at dinner. 
 I'm afraid that's my doing, Severus. You see, Harry was helping me
      answer my fan mail... 

    
 That's why Ron and I went looking for him, Professor. We'd just found him
      when Harry said... 

      
 Yes, Miss Granger? 
 When I said I wasn't hungry. We were heading back to the Common Room and...
      found Mrs. Norris. 

    
 Innocent until proven guilty. 
 My cat has been Petrified! I want to see some punishment! 
 We will be able to cure her, Argus. As I understand it, Madam Sprout has
      a very healthy growth of Mandrakes. When they have matured, a potion will be made which will
      revive Mrs. Norris. In the meantime, I advise caution. To all. 
 A Squib's someone who's born into a wizarding family but hasn't got any powers
      of their own. It's why Filch is trying to learn magic from a Kwikspell course. It's also why
      he hates students so much. He's bitter. 

    
 Harry. This voice. You said you heard it first in Lockhart's office? 
 Yes. 
 And did he hear it? 
 He said he didn't. 
 Maybe he was lying. 
 I hardly think someone with Gilderoy Lockhart's credentials would lie to
      one of his students, Ronald. Besides, if you recall, we didn't hear anything either. 
 You do believe me, don't you? 
 'Course we do. It's just... it's a bit weird, isn't it? You hear this voice
      and then... Mrs. Norris turns up Petrified. 
 I can't explain it -- it was... scary. 
 D'you think I
      should've told them -- Dumbledore and the others, I mean. 
 Are you mad! 
 No, Harry. Even in the wizarding world, hearing voices isn't a good sign.
    
 Today, we will be turning animals into water goblets. 

    
 Now, who would like to go first... Mr. Weasley? 

    
 You must replace that wand, Mr. Weasley. 

    
 Yes, Miss Granger? 
 Professor, I was wondering if you could tell us about the Chamber of
      Secrets? 

    
 My subject is Transfiguration, Miss Granger. 
 Yes, Professor. But there seems to be very little written about the Chamber
      of Secrets. For those of us with a personal interest in the subject, that is... disturbing.
        

    
 Very well. You all know, of course, that Hogwarts was founded over a
      thousand years ago by the four greatest witches and wizards of the age: Godric Gryffindor,
      Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and Salazar Slytherin. Three of the founders co-existed
      quite harmoniously. One did not. 
 Three glasses who? 
 Salazar Slytherin wished to be more selective about the students admitted
      to Hogwarts. He believed that magical learning should be kept within all-magic families. In
      other words, purebloods. Unable to sway the others, he decided to leave the school. 
 According to legend, Slytherin had built a hidden chamber in this castle, known
      as the Chamber of Secrets. Shortly before departing, he sealed it until that time when his own
      true heir returned to the school. The heir alone would be able to open the Chamber of Secrets
      and unleash the horror within, and by so doing, purge the school of all those who, in
      Slytherin's view, were unworthy to study magic. 
 Muggle-borns. 
 Yes. Naturally, the school has been searched many times for such a
      chamber. It has never been found. 
 Professor, what exactly does legend tell us lies within the Chamber? 
 The Chamber is said to be home to something which the heir of Slytherin
      alone can control. It is said to be home... to a monster. 

    
 D'you think it's true? D'you think there really is a Chamber of Secrets? 
 Yes. Couldn't you tell: McGonagall's worried. All the teachers are. 
 But if there really is a Chamber of Secrets, and it's really been opened, that
      means... 
 The Heir of Slytherin has returned to Hogwarts. The question is, who is it? 

      
 Let's think. Who do we know who thinks Muggle-borns are
      scum. 

      
 If you're talking about him -- 
 Of course! You heard him: 'You'll be next, Mudbloods'! 
 I heard him. But Malfoy? The Heir of Slytherin? 
 Maybe Ron's right, Hermione. I mean, look at his family. The whole lot of them
      have been in Slytherin for centuries. 
 Crabbe and Goyle must know. Maybe we could trick them into telling... 
 No. Even they aren't that thick. But there might be another way. Mind you,
      it would be difficult. Not to mention we'd be breaking about fifty school rules. And it would
      be dangerous. Very dangerous. 
 When do we start? 
 Here it is: 'The Polyjuice Potion. Properly brewed, the Polyjuice Potion
      allows the drinker to transform himself temporarily into the physical form of another...' 
 You mean, Harry and I drink some of this stuff and we turn into Crabbe and
      Goyle? 
 Yes. 
 Wicked! Malfoy'll tell us anything! 
 Exactly. But it's tricky. I've never seen a more complicated potion.
      Lacewing flies, leeches, fluxweed. And, of course, we'll need a bit of whoever we want to
      change into too. 
 Hang on now. I'm drinking nothing with Crabbe's toenails in it. 
 How long will it take to make? 
 A month. 
 A month? But if Malfoy is the heir of Slytherin... he could attack half the
      Muggle-borns in the school by then. 
 You didn't have to tell me that. 
 Gallopin' Gorgons! Slytherin's flyin' like they got dragon fire in their
      brooms... 

      

    
 All right there, Scarhead? 

    
 HARRY! WATCH OUT! 

    

      
 Blimey, Harry's got 'imself a Rogue Bludger! 
 Rogue Bludger? 
 Look fer yerself! It's bin' tampered with! 

      

    
 You're joking, right? Besides, even with a proper wand, it's too risky. You
      could hit Harry. 

    
 Training for the ballet, Potter? 

    
 Finite Incantatem! 

    
 Not to worry, Harry. I'll fix that arm of yours straight away. 
 No... no... not you. 
 Poor boy doesn't know what he's saying. This won't hurt a bit...
        

    
 Ah. Yes. Well, that can sometimes happen. The point is, the bones
      are no longer broken. 
 Brok'n? He doesn't 'ave any bones at all! 

    
 He should have been brought straight to me! I can mend bones in a
      heartbeat -- but growing them back -- 
 You will be able to, won't you? 
 I'll be able to, certainly, but it will be painful. You're in for a
      rough night, Potter. Regrowing bones is nasty business. 

    
 Well, what did you expect -- pumpkin juice? 

    
 That was brilliant today, Harry! Brilliant! 
 Out! All of you! This boy's got thirty-three bones to regrow! 
 Dobby! 
 Harry Potter came back to school. Dobby warned him. Harry Potter should have
      listened to Dobby. Harry Potter should have gone back home when he missed the train. 

      
 It was you! You stopped the barrier from letting Ron
      and me through! 
 Indeed yes, sir. Dobby hid and watched for Harry Potter and sealed the
      gateway. 
 You nearly got Ron and me expelled! 
 At least you would be away from here. Harry Potter must go home! Dobby thought
      his Bludger would be enough to make Harry Potter see -- 
 Your Bludger? You made that Bludger chase after me? 
 Dobby feels most aggrieved, sir. 
 Dobby had
      to iron his hands... 
 You'd better clear off before my bones come back, Dobby, or I might strangle
      you! 

      
 Dobby is used to death threats, sir. Dobby gets them five times
      a day at home. 
 I don't suppose you could tell me why you're trying to kill me? 
 Not kill you, sir, never kill you! Dobby remembers how it was before Harry
      Potter triumphed over He Who Must Not Be Named. We house elves were treated like vermin, sir.
      Of course, Dobby is still treated like vermin... 

    
 Why do you wear that thing, Dobby? 
 This, sir? 'Tis a mark of the house elf's enslavement. Dobby can only be freed
      if his master presents him with clothes. The family is careful not to pass Dobby so much as a
      sock, sir, for then he would be free to leave their house forever. 

    
 Terrible things are about to happen at Hogwarts! Harry Potter must not stay
      here now that history is to repeat itself! 
 Repeat itself? You mean, this has happened before? 

    
 Tell me, Dobby? When did this happen before? Who's doing it now? 
 Dobby cannot say, sir. Dobby only wants Harry Potter to be safe. 
 Who is it? No, Dobby! Tell me! 

    
 What's happened? 
 There's been another attack. 

    
 Perhaps he managed to get a picture of his attacker... 

    
 What does this mean, Albus? 
 It means our students are in great danger, Minerva. Mr. Creevey was
      fortunate. If not for this... 
 He would surely be dead. 
 What should I tell the staff, Albus? 
 Tell them the truth. Tell them Hogwarts is no longer safe. Tell them it's
      as we feared. The Chamber of Secrets is indeed open again. 
 Again? You mean, the Chamber of Secrets has been opened before? 
 Of course! Don't you see? Lucius Malfoy must've opened it when he was at school
      here, and now he's told Draco how to do it. 
 Maybe. We'll have to wait for the Polyjuice Potion to know for sure. 
 Enlighten me. Why are we brewing this potion in broad daylight, in the middle of
      a girls' lavatory? Don't you think we'll get caught? 
 Never. No one over comes in here. 
 Why? 
 Moaning Myrtle. 
 Who's Moaning Myrtle? 

    
 I'm Moaning Myrtle. I wouldn't expect you to know me. Who would ever
      talk about fat, ugly, miserable, moping, moaning Myrtle? 

    
 She's a little sensitive. 
 Gather round! Gather round! Can everyone see me? Can you all hear
      me? Excellent. In light of the dark events of recent weeks, Professor Dumbledore has granted
      me permission to start this little Dueling Club, to train you all up in case you ever need to
      defend yourselves as I myself have done on countless occasions -- for full details, see my
      published works. 

    
-FLETCHLEY That Lockhart's something, isn't he? Awfully brave chap.
        
 Justin Finch-Fletchley. Hufflepuff. 
 Nice to meet you. I'm -- 
-FLETCHLEY I know who you are. We all do. Even us Muggle-borns.
        

    
 Let me introduce my assistant Professor Snape. He has sportingly
      agreed to help me with a short demonstration. Now I don't want any of you youngsters to worry.
      You'll still have your Potions Master when I'm through with him, never fear! 
 What's the fun in that? 

    
 As you can see, we are holding our wands in the accepted combative
      position. On the count of three, we will cast our first spells. Neither of us will be aiming
      to kill, of course. 

      
 I wouldn't bet on that. 
 One-two-three -- 
 Expelliarmus! 

    
 Do you think he's all right? 
 Who cares? 

      
 Well, there you have it. That was a Disarming Charm. As you
      see, I've lost my wand. 

      
 Ah, thank you, Miss Granger. Yes, an excellent idea to
      show them that, Professor Snape, but if you don't mind my saying so, it was very obvious what
      you were about to do. If I had wanted to stop you it would have been only too easy... 
 Perhaps it would be prudent to first teach the students to block unfriendly
      spells, Professor. 
 An excellent suggestion, Professor Snape. Let's have a volunteer
      pair. Potter, Weasley, how about you? 
 Weasley's wand causes devastation with the simplest spells. We'll be sending
      Potter to the hospital wing in a matchbox. Might I suggest someone from my own house. Malfoy,
      perhaps. 

    
 Scared, Potter? 
 You wish. 

    
 Wands at the ready! When I count to three, cast your charms to
      disarm your opponent -- only to disarm. We don't want any accidents. One, two -- 

    
 Rictusempra! 

    
 I said disarm only! 
 Serpensortia! 

    
 Don't move, Potter. I'll get rid of it for you. 
 Allow me! 

    

      
 Leave him! 

    

      
 LEAVE HIM! 

    
-FINCH-FLETCHLEY What are you playing at? 

    

      
 Come on. Move. Now. 
 You're a Parselmouth! Why didn't you tell us? 
 I'm a what? 
 You can talk to snakes. 
 I know. I mean, I accidentally set a python on my cousin Dudley at the zoo
      once. But so what? I bet loads of people here can do it. 
 No. They can't. It's not a very common gift, Harry. This is bad. 
 What's bad? If I hadn't told that snake not to attack Justin -- 
 Oh, that's what you said to it. 
 You were there! You heard me! 
 I heard you speaking Parseltongue. Snake language. 
 I spoke a different language? But I didn't realize -- how can I speak a
      language without knowing I can? 
 I don't know, Harry. But it sounded like you were egging the snake on or
      something. It was... creepy. 

    
 Harry, listen out me. There's a reason the symbol of Slytherin house is a
      serpent. Salazar Slytherin was a Parselmouth. He could talk to snakes too. 
 Exactly. And now the whole school's going to think you're his great-great-great
      grandson or something. 
 But I'm not. I... can't be. 
 He lived a thousand years ago. For all we know... you could be. 
 Who am I, Hedwig? What am I? 
 So, anyway, I told Justin to hide up in our dormitory. I mean to say, if
      Potter's marked him down as his next victim, it's best he keep a low profile for a while. 
 But why would he want to attack Justin? 
 Justin let it slip to Potter that he was Muggle-born. 
 And you definitely think Potter's the Heir of Slytherin? 
 Hannah, he's a Parselmouth. Everyone knows that's the mark of a dark wizard.
      Have you ever heard of a decent one who could talk to snakes? They called Slytherin himself
      Serpent-tongue. 
 Remember what was written on the wall:
      Enemies of the Heir Beware. Potter had some sort of run-in with Filch. Next thing we know,
      Filch's cat's attacked. That first-year Creevey's been annoying Potter. Then Creevey's
      attacked. 
 He always seems so nice, though. And, after all, he is the one who made You
      Know Who disappear. 
 That's probably why You Know Who wanted to kill him in the first place. Didn't
      want another Dark Lord competing with him. 

    
 All righ', Harry? 
 Hagrid... what're you doing here? 

      
 Second one killed this term. Reckon it's either foxes or
      a Blood-Suckin' Bugbear. Need Dumbledore's permission ter put a charm round the hen-coop. Yeh
      sure yeh're all righ', Harry? Yeh look all hot an' bothered. 
 It's nothing. I'd better get going. I've got a lot of studying... 
 Professor, I swear I didn't -- 
 This is out of my hands, Potter. Mr. Filch, will you take care of this,
      please? 

    
 Caught in the act. I'll have you out this time, Potter. Mark my words...
        

    
 Dark magic. That's what you've got, Potter. Even the air you breathe comes out
      poison. You're evil. Evil as they come... 
 Sherbet lemon. 

    
 Professor Dumbledore will be waiting for you. 

    
 Bee in your bonnet, Potter? 
 Well, you see, I was wondering... 
 If I put you in the right house? Yes...you were particularly difficult to
      place. But I stand by what I said last year... you would have done well in Slytherin.
        

    
 You're wrong! 

    
 Professor, your bird... I couldn't do anything... He just caught fire. 
 About time too. He's been looking dreadful for days. Pity you had to see
      him on a Burning Day. He's really very handsome most of the time. 
 Fawkes is a phoenix, Harry. Phoenixes burst into flame when it is time for them
      to die and are reborn from the ashes. 

    
 Fascinating creatures, phoenixes. They can carry immensely heavy loads,
      their tears have healing powers, and they make highly faithful pets. 

    
 It wasn't Harry, Professor Dumbledore! 
 Hagrid -- 
 I was talkin' ter 'im jus' before that kid was found. It can't've bin 'im! 
 Hagrid -- 
 I'll swear ter it in front o' the Ministry o' Magic -- 
 HAGRID! I do not think that Harry has attacked anyone. 
 Oh. Right. I'll wait outside then. 

    
 You don't think it was me, Professor? 
 No, Harry. But I must ask you... is there anything you'd like to tell me.
      Anything at all? 

    
 No, Professor. Nothing. 
 Make way for the Heir of Slytherin! Seriously evil wizard coming through!
        

    
 Oh, c'mon, Harry. Fred's just having a laugh. 
 He's the only one. 
 Okay, so half the school thinks you're nipping off to the Chamber of Secrets
      every night. Who cares? 
 Maybe they're right. 

      
 Harry! 

      
 I didn't know I could speak Parseltongue. What else don't I know
      about myself? Maybe you can do something... even something horrible... and not know you did
      it. 
 You don't believe that, Harry, I know you don't. And if it makes you feel
      better, I just heard Malfoy's staying over for holiday, too. 
 Why would that make anyone feel better? 
 Because, in a few days, the Polyjuice Potion's will be ready. In a few
      days... we may truly know who is the Heir of Slytherin. 
 Everything's set. We just need a bit of who you're changing into. 
 Crabbe and Goyle. 
 And we also need to make sure that the real Crabbe and Goyle can't burst in
      on us while we're interrogating Malfoy. 
 How? 

    
 I've got it all worked out. I've filled these with a simple Sleeping
      Draught. Simple, but powerful. 

    
 You know how greedy Crabbe and Goyle are. They won't leave the Christmas
      Feast until every last drop of trifle is gone. Now, once they're asleep, hide them in a broom
      cupboard and pull out a few of their hairs. 
 And whose hair are you ripping out? 
 I've already got mine. 

    
 Millicent Bulstrode. She's in Slytherin. I got this off her robes.
        
 All right then... I'm going to check on the Polyjuice Potion.
        

    
 Remember. Just make sure Crabbe and Goyle find these. 

    
 Have you ever heard of a plan where so many things could go wrong? 
 Did you get it? 

    
 I sneaked those out of the laundry. 

    
 I'm sure I've done everything right. It looks like the book said it should.
      Once we've drunk it, we'll have exactly one hour before we change back into ourselves. 
 Now what? 
 We separate it into three glasses and add the hairs. 

    
 Ugh. Essence of Crabbe... 

    
 Think I'm gonna be sick... 

    
 Harry? 
 Ron? 
 Bloody hell. 
 We still sound like ourselves. You need to sound more like Crabbe. 

      
 Bloody hell. 
 Lower. 

      
 Bloody hell. 
 Less intelligent. 

      
 Bloody hell. 
 Excellent. 
 Hey... Where's Hermione? 

      

      
 I -- I don't think I'm going. You go on without me. 
 Hermione, are you okay? 

      
 Just go! You're wasting time! 
 Don't swing your arms like that. Crabbe holds them sort of stiff. 

    
 Yeah. That's better. 
 What are you doing here? 

    
 What are you doing here? 
 I happen to be a prefect. You, on the other hand, have no business wandering
      the corridors at night. It's not safe these days. 

    
 What're your names again? 
 Crabbe. Goyle. Where have you been? Pigging out in the Great Hall all this
      time? 

    
 And what are you doing down here, Weasley? 
 Mind your attitude, Malfoy. You want to show a little bit more respect to a
      school Prefect! 
 Come on, boys. Weasley thinks he's going to catch Slytherin's hair
      single-handed. 

    
 Listen to this... 

    
 'Arthur Weasley, Head of the Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office, was today
      fined fifty Galleons for bewitching a Muggle car. "Weasley has brought the Ministry into
      disrepute," said Lucius Malfoy, a governor of Hogwarts. "He is clearly unfit to draw up our
      laws and his ridiculous Muggle Protection Act should be scrapped immediately."'
        

    
 Arthur Weasley loves Muggle so much he should snap his wand in half and go
      join them. You'd never know the Weasleys were purebloods, the way they behave. Embarrassment
      to the wizarding world. All of them. 

    
 What's up with you, Crabbe? 

      
 Stomachache. 
 Well, go to the hospital wing and give all those Mudbloods a kick in the arse
      for me! You know, I'm surprised The Daily Prophet hasn't reported all these attacks yet. I
      suppose Dumbledore's trying to hush it all up. He'll be sacked if it doesn't stop soon. Father
      always said Dumbledore's the worst thing that's ever happened to this place. 
 You're wrong! 
 What? Did you say that I was wrong? You think there's someone here who's worse
      than Dumbledore? 

    
 Harry Potter. 

      
 Good one, Goyle. You're absolutely right. Saint Potter. He's another
      one with no proper wizard feeling, or he wouldn't go around with that Mudblood Granger. And
      people actually think he's the Heir of Slytherin. 

    
 Then you must have some idea who's behind it all? 
 You know I haven't, Goyle. How many times do I have to tell you? But my father
      did say this much: It's been fifty years since the Chamber was opened. He wouldn't tell me who
      opened it -- only that they were expelled -- but I know this: the last time the Chamber of
      Secrets was opened, a Mudblood died. 
 So it's only a matter of time before one of them's killed this time. As for
      me... I hope it's Granger. 

    
 What's the matter with you two? You're acting very... odd. 
 Ho! 

    
 Hey! Where are you going? 
 That was close! 
 Hermione, come out. We've got loads to tell you! 
 Go away! 

    
 Ooh, wait till you see. It's awful! 

    

      
 Do you remember me telling you the Polyjuice Potion was only for human
      transformations...? 

    
 It was cat hair I plucked off Millicent Bulstrode's robes! Look at my face! 
 Look at your tail. 
 Oh, good. Put those anywhere. 

    
 Madam Pince asked that we relay a message to you, Hermione: She'd appreciate it
      if you'd leave a few books for the rest of the school. 
 I've got to keep up, haven't I? 

    
 Is that thing ever going away? 
 Any day now, according to Madam Pomfrey. I'm just thankful I've stopped
      coughing up fur balls. 
 We all are, believe me. 
 Now. What about the Chamber of Secrets? Any new leads? 
 Nothing. 
 And has it gotten any better? I mean... is anyone speaking to you? 
 Neville asked to borrow a tubeworm in Potions yesterday. I suppose that's
      something. 

    
 'To Miss Granger. Wishing you a speedy recovery, from your concerned teacher
      Gilderoy Lockhart.' You sleep with this under your pillow? 
 Of course not. I don't know how that got there. Now go. I still have six
      hundred pages to read in Transformation Through the Ages. 
 I know Hermione's mental, but can you believe she falls for that smarmy nonsense
      of Lockhart's? 

    
 Looks like Myrtle's flooded the bathroom. 

    
 Yuck. 
 Come to throw something else at me? 
 Why would I throw something at you? 
 Don't ask me. Here I am, minding my own business, and someone thinks
      it's funny to throw a book at me... 
 But it can't hurt if someone throws something at you. I mean, it'd just go right
      through you, wouldn't it? 
 Oh sure! Let's all throw books at Myrtle, because she can't feel it!
      Ten points if you can get it through her stomach. Fifty points if it goes through her head! 
 Who threw it at you anyway? 
 I don't know. I didn't see them. I was just sitting in the U-bend,
      thinking about death and it fell through the top of my head. 

    
 Fifty points if you can get it through her nose. 
 I HEARD THAT! 

    
 This is a diary. And it's old... 
 It's a diary, it's old... and was most recently in a toilet, Harry. 

    
 Are you mad? That could be cursed. Dad once told me about a book the Ministry
      confiscated that burned the eyes out of anyone who tried to read it. 
 I'll take my chances... 
 Ahhh! MY EYES! MY EYES!
        

    
 Ginny! I was only joking -- Brilliant. Even your sister thinks I'm the monster
      now. 
 Who doesn't? 

    
 Tom Marvolo Riddle? Hang on. I know that name... 

      Of course! The night I had detention... My job was to polish the silver in the trophy room. I
      remember because I kept burping slugs all over Tom Riddle's trophy. I must have wiped slime
      off his name for an hour. 

    
 That's odd. He never wrote in it. 
 Tom Riddle... Hm. And Ron said he won an award fifty years ago? 
 Special Services to the School or something -- 
 Fifty years ago? You're sure? 
 Yes. Why? 
 Don't you remember what Malfoy told you? The last time the Chamber of
      Secrets was opened was -- 
 Fifty years ago! That means -- 
 Tom Riddle was here, at Hogwarts, when it happened. What if he wrote about
      what he saw? It's possible he knew where the Chamber was, how to open it, even what sort of
      creature lives in it. If so, whoever's behind the attacks this time wouldn't want a diary like
      this lying around, would they? 
 That's a brilliant theory, Hermione. With just one tiny little flaw. There's
      nothing written in this diary. 
 It might be invisible ink. 
 Aparecium!
        

    
 I don't know, Harry. But I think you should be careful with this. Something
      tells me Ron might be right. It could be dangerous. 
 You don't think I'm dangerous, do you, Hermione? I mean, you're not scared. Of
      me. 
 I'm scared, Harry. But not of you. 
 Do... you... know... anything... about... the... Chamber... of... Secrets?
        

    
 Can... you... tell... me? 

      

      

    
 Excuse me. Could you tell me where I am? Hello...? 

    

      
 Riddle. 

    
 Professor Dumbledore. 
 It's not wise to be wandering around this late, Tom. 
 Yes, Professor. I suppose I -- I just had to see for myself, if...
        

    
 ... the rumors were true. 
 I'm afraid they are, Tom. 
 About the school as well? They wouldn't really close Hogwarts, would they,
      Professor? 
 Headmaster Dippet may have no choice, I'm afraid. 
 Sir? If it all stopped. If the person responsible was caught... 
 Is there something you wish to tell me, Tom? 

      
 No, sir. Nothing. 

    
 Very well then. Hurry along. 

    

      
 C'mon, Aragog. Gotta get yeh outta here... C'mon now.. in the box...
        

    
 Evening, Hagrid. 

    
 I'm going to have to turn you in, Hagrid. I don't think you meant it to
      kill anyone -- 
 No, yeh can't! Yeh don' understand! 
 Hagrid. The dead girl's parents will be here tomorrow. The least Hogwarts
      can do is make sure the thing that killed their daughter is slaughtered. 
 It wasn' him! Aragog never'd kill no one! Never! 
 Monsters don't make good pets, Hagrid. Now... stand aside... 

    
 Noooooo! 

    
 Ron! Ron! 
 What? What's happened...? 
 It was Hagrid. Hagrid opened the Chamber of Secrets fifty years ago. 
 It can't be Hagrid. It just can't be. 
 We don't even know this Riddle. He sounds like a dirty, rotten snitch to me. 
 The monster had killed someone, Ron. What would any of us done? 
 Look. Hagrid's our friend. Why don't we just go ask him about it? 
 That'd be a cheerful visit. Hullo, Hagrid. Tell us, have you been setting
      anything mad and hairy loose in the castle lately? 
 Mad an' hairy? Wouldn' be talkin' 'bou me, now would yeh? 

    
 No! 

    
 What's that you've got, Hagrid? 
 Flesh-Eatin' Slug Repellent. Fer the Mandrakes, yeh know. Accordin' ter
      Professor Sprout, they still got a bit o' growin' up ter do, but once their acne clears up,
      we'll be able to chop 'em up, stew 'em, an' get those people in the hospital un-Petrified.
      'Til then, you three best watch yerselves, all righ'? 

    
 Harry, I don't know who did it, but... you'd better come. 
 It had to be a Gryffindor. Nobody else knows our password. Unless, it
      wasn't a student... 
 Well, whoever it was, they were looking for something. 
 And they found it... Tom Riddle's diary is gone. 
 Hey, Ginny! Going to the match? 

    
 I tell you, she gets weirder and weirder by the day... 

      
 Kill this time... Let me rip... Tear. 

    
 No... don't tell me... 

    
 Harry... I think I've just understood something! I've got to go to the
      library! 

    
 What do you understand! 

    
 The library? 
 That's Hermione. When in doubt, go to the library 
 Listen up now. We play our game, Hufflepuff doesn't stand a chance. We're
      stronger, quicker, smarter. 
 Not to mention they're dead terrified Harry'll Petrify them if they fly
      anywhere near him. 
 That, too. 

    
 Professor McGonagall -- 
 This match has been cancelled. 
 Cancelled! They can't cancel Quidditch -- 
 Silence, Wood! You will return to Gryffindor Tower now. Potter, you and I
      will find Mr. Weasley. There's something the both of you need to see. 
 I warn you. This will be a bit of a shock. 

    
 Hermione! 
 She was found near the library. Along with this. Does it mean anything to
      either of you? 

    
 All students will return to their house common rooms by six o'clock in
      the evening. You will be escorted to each lesson by a teacher. No exceptions. 
 I should tell you all this. Unless the culprit behind these attacks
      is caught, it is likely that the school will be closed. 

    
 Haven't any of the teachers noticed that the Slytherins are all safe? Isn't
      it obvious all this stuff's coming from Slytherin? The Heir of Slytherin, the monster of
      Slytherin -- why don't they just chuck all the Slytherins out? 
 They can't close Hogwarts. Where would we all go? 
 I don't care what anyone says. As long as Dumbledore's here, Hogwarts
      will be here. 

    
 We've got to talk to Hagrid, Ron. I can't believe it's him. But if he did set
      the monster loose last time -- even by accident -- he'll know how to get inside the Chamber of
      Secrets. And that's a start. 
 But you heard McGonagall. We're not allowed to leave the tower except for class
      -- 
 I think it's time to get my Dad's old Cloak out again. 
 Who's there? 

    
 What's that for? 
 Nothin', nothin'. I've been expectin'... Doesn't matter. Sit down... I'll
      make tea... 

    
 Are you okay? Hagrid? Did you hear about Hermione? 
 Oh, yea. I heard, all righ'. 
 Look... we have to ask you something. Do you know who's opened the Chamber of
      Secrets? 

    
 C-come in. 

    
 Good evening, Hagrid. 

      
 That's Dad's boss! Cornelius Fudge. The Minister of Magic!
        

    
 Bad business, Hagrid. Very bad business. Had to come. Four attacks on
      Muggle-borns. Things've gone far enough. Ministry's got to act. 
 I never... You know I never, Professor Dumbledore, sir... 
 I want it understood, Cornelius, that Hagrid has my full confidence. 
 Look, Albus, Hagrid's record's against him. I've got to take him. 
 Take me? Where? Not Azkaban prison. 
 For a short stretch only. Not a punishment, Hagrid. More a precaution. If
      someone else is caught, you'll be released with a full apology. 

    
 Already here, Fudge? Good, good... 
 What're you doin' here! Get outta my house! 
 My dear man, please believe me, I have no pleasure at all in being
      inside your -- do you call this a house? I simply called at the school and was told the
      Headmaster was here. 
 And what exactly did you want with me, Lucius? 
 Dreadful thing, Dumbledore, but the governors feel it's time for you to
      step aside. This is an Order of Suspension. You'll find all twelve signatures on it. I'm
      afraid we feel you're losing your touch. What with all these attacks, there'll be no Muggle-
      borns left at Hogwarts. And we all know what an awful loss that would be. 

    
 Now, see here, Lucius. Dumbledore suspended. No, no... last thing we want
      right now... If Dumbledore can't stop these attacks... I mean to say, who can? 
 That remains to be seen, but as all twelve governors have voted -- 
 An' how many did yeh have ter threaten before they agreed! 
 I would advise you not to shout at the Azkaban guards like that. 
 Yeh can take Dumbledore! Take him away an' the Muggle-borns won' stand a
      chance! There'll be killin's next! 
 Calm yourself, Hagrid! 
 If the governors want
      my removal, Lucius, I shall of course step aside. However... you will find that I will only
      truly have left this school when none here are loyal to me. You will also find that help will
      always be given at Hogwarts to those who... ask for it. 

    
 Admirable sentiments. We shall all miss your highly individual way of
      running things, Albus, and only hope your successor will manage to prevent any more, um,
      killin's. 
. 
 If anyone wanted ter find out some stuff, all they'd have ter do is follow
      the spiders. That'd lead 'em right! Tha's all I'm sayin'. 

    
 Hagrid's right. With Dumbledore gone, there'll be an attack a day. 
 Look... 

    
 C'mon. 
 What are you doing? 
 You heard Hagrid. Follow the spiders. 
 They're heading into the Dark Forest. 

    
 Why spiders. Why couldn't it be 'Follow the butterflies'? 
 There's something moving over there... something big. 

    
 Harry!... Harry, it's our car! 

    
 It's been here all the time! Look at it. The Forest has turned it wild.
        

    
 C'mon, we don't want to lose the trail. 
 I don't have a good feeling about this, Harry -- 
 Don't panic. As Harry steps to the mouth of the cavern, the AIR suddenly
      CRACKLES with MOVEMENT. TWIGS SNAP. A HUGE SHADOW emerges, slowly engulfs Harry. He peers up.
      SEES: An ANCIENT SPIDER 
, the size of a small elephant. As it advances,
      Harry and Ron back slowly away. Then: its BLIND EYES catch the light, and it STOPS. As if...
      listening. 
 You do not come from the forest. Your hearts beat like... men. 

      
 Yes. We're friends of Hagrid's. And you... you're...
        
 ... Aragog, aren't you? 

    
 Hagrid has never sent men into our hollow before. 
 He's in trouble. Up at school, there've been attacks. They think it's Hagrid.
      They think he's opened the Chamber of Secrets. Like before. 

    
 That's a lie! Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets! 
 But if Hagrid never... that means... you're not the monster. 
 The monster was born in the castle. I came from a distant land, in the pocket
      of a traveler. 

    
 Harry... 
 Shhh! 
 But if you're not the monster, what did kill
      that girl fifty years ago? 
 We do not speak of it! It is an ancient creature we spiders fear above all
      others. 
 But have you seen it? 

    
 I never saw any part of the castle but the cupboard in which Hagrid kept me.
      The girl was discovered in a bathroom. When I was accused, Hagrid brought me here. 

    

      
 What! 

    
 Well... thank you. We'll just go... 
 Go? I think not. My sons and daughters do not harm Hagrid, on my command. But
      I cannot deny them fresh meat when it wanders so willingly into our midst. Goodbye, friend of
      Hagrid. 

    
 Can we panic now? 

    
 Nice knowing you. 

    
 Let's go! 

    
 THE WINDOWS! ROLL UP THE WINDOWS! 

      
 I CAN'T! IT'S STUCK! 

    
 Thanks for that. 
 Don't mention it. 

    
 That way! It's the only way out! 
 Hurry! They're
      catching up! 

    
 Can you get us in the air? 

      
 Flying gear's jammed! 

    
 'Follow the spiders'! Follow the spiders'! If he ever gets out of Azkaban, I'll
      kill Hagrid. I mean, what was the point of sending us in there? What have we found out? 
 We know one thing. Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets. He was
      innocent. 
 There's no point in talking to a petrified person. She won't hear a
      word you're saying. 

    
 We know that, Madam Pomfrey. It's just, well, you see, we thought, maybe, we
      could... be with her for a bit. She's our... friend, you see, and... even if she can't hear
      us... I mean, it can't hurt, can it? 

    
 Very well then. But be quick about it. 

    
 You don't think Lockhart could be the heir of Slytherin, do you? 
 Right. Forget I said it. 

    
 Wish you were here, Hermione. We need you. Now more than ever... 

    
 'Of the many fearsome beasts that roam our land, none is more deadly than the
      Basilisk. Capable of living for hundreds of years, instant death awaits any who meet this
      giant serpent's eye. Spiders flee before it and only the crowing of the rooster can kill it.'
        
 Ron! This is it! The monster in the Chamber of Secrets is a
      Basilisk. That's why I can hear it speak. It's a snake. 
 But it kills by looking people in the eye. Why is it no one's dead? 

    
 Because no one did look it in the eye. Not directly at least... 
 Colin saw it through his camera. Justin -- Justin must've seen the Basilisk
      through Nearly Headless Nick! Nick got the full blast of it, but he's a ghost -- he couldn't
      die again... 
 ... And Hermione... had the mirror! I bet you anything she was using it to
      look round corners, in case it came along. 
 And Mrs. Norris? I'm pretty sure she didn't have a camera or a mirror, Harry. 
 The water... there was water on the floor that night. She only saw the
      Basilisk's reflection... 
 The crowing of the rooster is
      fatal to it! That's why Hagrid's roosters were killed! Spiders flee before it! It all fits! 
 But how's the Basilisk been getting around? A dirty great snake. Someone would
      have seen... 
 Hermione answered that too. 

    

      
 Pipes...? It's using the plumbing. 
 Remember what Aragog said? About that girl fifty years ago? She died in a
      bathroom. What if she never left. 
 Moaning Myrtle! 

    

      
 All students are to return to their house dormitories at once. All
      teachers to the second floor corridor. Immediately. 
 As you can see, the Heir of Slytherin has left another message. Our worst
      fear has been realized. A student has been taken by the monster. Into the Chamber itself.
        
 I'm afraid we shall have to send the students home. I'm
      afraid... this is the end of Hogwarts. 

      
 So sorry. Dozed off. What have I missed? 
 Just the man. A girl has been snatched by the monster, Lockhart. Your moment
      has come at last. 
 My m-moment? 
 Weren't you saying just last night that you've known all along where the
      entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is? 
 D-did I? I don't recall... 
 That settles it. We'll leave it to you to deal with the monster,
      Gilderoy. Your skills, after all, are legend. 
 V-very well. I'll -- I'll be in my office, getting -- getting
      ready. 
 The rest of us should go and inform the students what has happened. 
 Who is it the monster's taken, Minerva? 
 Ginny Weasley. 

    
 She knew something, Harry. She'd found out something about the Chamber of
      Secrets. That's why she was taken. I mean, she was -- is -- a pure-blood. There can't be any
      other reason. 

      
 C'mon. Let's go see Lockhart. He may be a brainless git, but
      he's going to try and get into the Chamber. We can tell him what we know... 
 Harry. D'you think there's any chance at all she's not, you know -- 

    
 We'll find her, Ron. Ginny's going to be fine. 

    
 Professor, we've got some information for you -- 

    
 Are you going somewhere? 
 Um, well, yes. Urgent call. Unavoidable. Got to go... 
 What about my sister? 
 Well, as to that -- most unfortunate. No one regrets more than I -- 
 You're the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher! You can't go now! 
 I must say, when I took the job, nothing in the job description -- 
 You're running away? After all that stuff you did in your books? 
 Books can be misleading. 
 You wrote them! 
 My dear boy, do use your common sense. My books wouldn't have sold
      half as well if people didn't think I'd done all those things. No one wants to read about some
      ugly old Armenian warlock, even if he did save a village from werewolves. He'd look dreadful
      on the front cover. No dress sense at all... 
 You're a fraud! You've just been taking credit for what a load of other
      wizards have done! 
 Harry, Harry, Harry. There was work involved. I had to track these
      people down and ask them exactly how they managed to do what they did. No, it's not all book
      signings and publicity photos. You want fame, you have to be prepared for a long, hard slog. 
 Is there anything you can do? 
 Yes, now that you mention it. I'm rather gifted with Memory Charms.
      Otherwise, you see, all those wizards would've gone blabbing and I'd never have sold another
      book. I'm afraid I'll have to do the same to you both, lest you do the same. 

    
 Expelliarmus! 

    
 Looks like those Dueling Lessons came in handy after all, Professor. 
 Who's there? Oh... 
 Hello, Harry. What do
      you want? 
 To ask you how you died. 

      
 Oooooh, it was dreadful. It happened right here. In this very
      cubicle. I'd hidden because Olive Hornby was teasing me about my glasses. I was crying, and
      then I heard somebody come in. 
 Who was it, Myrtle? 
 I don't know! I was distraught! But they said something funny. A kind
      of made-up language. And I realized it was a boy speaking. So I unlocked the door, to tell him
      to go away, and... I died. 
 Just like that? How? 
 No idea. I just remember seeing a pair of great big yellow eyes. Over
      there... 

    
 This is it, Ron. This is the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets. 
 Say something, Harry. Say something in Parseltongue. 

    
 Open up. 

    
 English. 

    
 Excellent, Harry. Good work. Well then. I'll just be going. There's
      no need for me... 
 Oh, yes there is. You first. 

    
 Now, boys. What good will it do? 
 A bloody lot of good if it's a two-hundred-foot drop onto jagged rocks.
        

    

      
 It's really quite filthy down here. 
 All right. Let's go. 
 Oh, Harry... if you die down there, you're welcome to share my toilet. 
 Thanks, Myrtle. 

    
 Lumos! 

    
 Remember. Any sign of movement, close your eyes straight away. 

    
 What's that? Up ahead? 
 That looks like a... snake. 

    
 Maybe it's asleep. 

    
 Bloody hell. Whatever shed this must be twenty feet long. Or more. 

    
 Heart of a lion, this one. 

    
 The adventure ends here, boys! But don't fret. The world will know
      our story. How I was too late to save the girl. How you two tragically lost your minds at the
      sight of her mangled body. I'll even bind a limited edition in this snake skin. Say goodbye to
      your memories. 
 Obliviate! 

    
 Ron? Are you okay? 
 I'm okay. This git's not, though. He got blasted by my wand. 

    
 What now? 
 Wait here. I'll go on. I'll go on and... find Ginny. If I'm not back in an
      hour... He leaves it there. 
 I'll try and shift some of this rock. So you can get back through. And, Harry -- 
 See you in a bit. 

    

      
 Open. 

    
 Ginny! Please don't be dead. Wake up! Wake up! Ginny! 
 She won't wake. 

    
 Tom... Tom Riddle? What d'you mean, she won't wake? She's not... 
 She's still alive. But only just. 
 Are you a ghost? 
 A memory. Preserved in a diary for fifty years. 

    
 She's cold as ice. You've got to help me, Tom. There's a basilisk -- 
 It won't come until it's called. 

    
 Give me my wand, Tom. 
 You won't be needing it. 
 Listen, we've got to go! We've got to save her! 
 I'm afraid I can't do that, Harry. You see, as poor Ginny grows weaker...
      I grow stronger. 
 But she's dying! 
 Yes. I'm afraid so. But then, she's been in so much pain, poor Ginny.
      She's been writing to me for months, telling me all her pitiful worries and woes. Ginny poured
      her soul out to me. I grew stronger on a diet of her deepest fears, her darkest secrets. I
      grew powerful enough to start feeding Ginny a few secrets, to start pouring a bit of my soul
      back into her... 

    
 Yes, Harry, it was Ginny Weasley who opened the Chamber of Secrets. 
 No... she couldn't -- she wouldn't. 
 It was Ginny who set the Basilisk on the Mudbloods and the Squib's cat.
      Ginny who wrote threatening messages on the walls. 
 But... Why?... 
 Because I told her to. You'll find that I can be very persuasive. Not that
      she knew what she was doing. She was, shall we say, in a kind of trance. Still, the power of
      the diary began to scare her and she tried to dispose of it in the girls' bathroom. But then,
      who should find it... but you. The very person I was most anxious to meet. 

      
 And why did you want to meet me? 
 Ginny told me all about you. I knew I had to talk to you, meet you if I
      could. So I decided to show you my capture of that brainless oaf, Hagrid, to gain your trust. 
 Hagrid's my friend. And you framed him, didn't you? 
 It was my word against Hagrid's. Only Dumbledore seemed to think Hagrid
      was innocent. 
 I'll bet Dumbledore saw right through you. 
 I knew it wouldn't be safe to open the Chamber again while I was still at
      school. So I decided to leave behind a diary, preserving my sixteen-year-old self in its
      pages, so that one day... I would be able to lead another to finish Salazar Slytherin's noble
      work. 
 Well, you haven't finished it this time. In a few hours Mandrake Draught will
      be ready and everyone who was petrified will be all right again. 
 Haven't I told you, that killing Mudbloods doesn't matter to me anymore?
      For many months now, my new target has been... you. 
 Imagine my
      disappointment when I learned Ginny had stolen the diary back from you. 
 Ginny stole the diary from my room? But why? 
 She was afraid. Afraid you'd learn how to work the diary. Afraid I'd tell
      you just who it was that had been strangling all those roosters. 

    
 Come now, Harry. Don't look so disappointed. Had Ginny succeeded in
      destroying the diary, she would have destroyed me. And we couldn't be having this little talk.
      And I have so many questions for you. 
 Like what? 
 Well, how is it that a baby with no extraordinary magical talent managed
      to defeat the greatest wizard of all time? How did you escape with nothing but a scar, while
      Lord Voldemort's powers were destroyed? 
 Why do you care how I escaped? Voldemort was after your time. 
 Voldemort is my past, present and future. 

    
 You. You're the heir of Slytherin. You're Voldemort? 
 Surely you didn't think I would keep my filthy Muggle father's name? 
 No, I fashioned myself a new name, a name I knew wizards everywhere would
      one day fear to speak, when I became the greatest sorcerer in the world. 
 Albus Dumbledore is the greatest sorcerer in the world! 
 Dumbledore's been driven out of this castle by the mere memory of me. 
 He'll never be gone! Not as long as those who remain are loyal to him!
        

    
 Fawkes. 

    

      
 This is what Dumbledore sends his defender! A songbird and an old hat!
        

    

      
 Speak to me, Slytherin. 

    
 Let's match the powers of Lord Voldemort, Heir of Salazar Slytherin,
      against the famous Harry Potter, shall we? 

    

      
 Kill him! 

    
 Parseltongue won't save you now, Potter. The Basilisk only obeys me. 

      
 Don't look. Don't look into its eyes. 

    
 Fool! Think you're safe! It can still hear you! 

    
 Yes, Potter. The process is nearly complete. In a few minutes, Ginny
      Weasley will be dead. And I will cease to be a memory. Lord Voldemort will return. Very
      much... alive. 

    
 Remarkable, isn't it? How quickly the venom of the Basilisk penetrates the
      body? If you have any final words, Potter, you'd best speak them now. I'd guess you have
      little more than a minute to live. 

    
 So ends the famous Harry Potter. On his knees in the Chamber of Secrets.
      Defeated at last by the Dark Lord he so unwisely challenged. You'll be back with your dear
      Mudblood mother soon, Harry... 

    
 Funny, isn't it? The damage a silly little book can do? Especially in the
      hands of a silly little girl. 

    
 What are you doing? No. Stop... 

    
 No! 

    
 Harry. It was me! But I swear, I didn't mean to... Riddle made me. He wrote to
      me... took me over... I didn't even know whose diary it was. I found it inside my cauldron.
      The day we all went to Diagon Alley and... Harry. You're hurt... 
 Ginny. You need to get yourself out... Follow the chamber... You'll find
      Ron... 

    
 You were brilliant, Fawkes. I just... wasn't quick enough. 

    
 Of course. Dumbledore told me. Phoenix tears have healing powers.
        
 It's all right, Ginny. It's over. It's just a memory...
    
 Ginny! 

    
 You're alive. I can't believe it. 
 I'm going to be expelled, I just know it! 

      
 Remind you of anyone? 
 Where's Lockhart? 

    
 His Memory Charm backfired. Hasn't got a clue who he is. I keep having to stop
      him wandering off. He's a danger to himself. 
 Hello. Odd sort of place, this, isn't it? Do you live here? 
 No. 

    
 What's with the bird? 
 I think... I think he's telling me he can take us out of here. 
 Amazing! This is just like magic! 
 Ingenious. Simply... ingenious. 
 Of course, Tom
      Riddle was probably the most brilliant student Hogwarts has ever seen. I taught him myself
      fifty years ago. After he left, I would occasionally hear stories of his activities -- dark
      rumors -- but after awhile, even the rumors stopped. When he finally resurfaced as Lord
      Voldemort, most people had completely forgotten the clever Head Boy he'd once been. 
 I didn't know whose diary it was, sir. I swear. I found it inside my cauldron.
        
 The day we all went to Diagon Alley. 

    
 But I understand if... given all the trouble I've caused... if you -- 
 Wiser wizards than you have been hoodwinked by Lord Voldemort, Miss
      Weasley. No, I think you've endured enough. I would suggest a bit of bed rest, however. And
      perhaps a large mug of hot chocolate. I always find that cheers me up. Minerva, will you show
      Arthur and Molly up to the hospital wing? 
 Certainly, Albus. 

    
 A diary that writes back to you! Honestly, Ginny! What were you thinking?
      Haven't I always told you? Never trust anything that can think for itself if you can't see
      where it keeps its brain! 

    
 You two realize, of course, that in the last few hours, you have broken
      perhaps a dozen school rules? 
 Yes, sir. 
 And that there is sufficient evidence to expel you both? 
 Yes, sir. 
 Therefore, it seems only fitting... 
 That
      you both receive Special Awards for Services to the School. And -- let me see -- yes, I think
      two hundred points apiece, which, I believe, should be more than enough to secure Gryffindor
      the House Cup. 

      
 Thank you, sir. 
 Now, Mr. Weasley, if you would, have an owl deliver these release papers
      to Azkaban. We need our gamekeeper back. 

    
 First, Harry, I want to thank you. You must have shown me real loyalty
      down in the Chamber. Nothing but that could have called Fawkes to you. Secondly, I sense
      you're troubled by something. Am I right? 
 It's just, you see, sir, I couldn't help noticing certain things. Certain
      similarities. Between Tom Riddle and me. 
 You can speak Parseltongue, Harry, because Lord Voldemort can speak
      Parseltongue. Unless I'm much mistaken, he transformed some of his own powers to you the night
      he gave you that scar. 
 Voldemort put a bit of himself in me? 
 Not intentionally, but... yes. 
 So the Sorting Hat was right. I should be a Slytherin. 
 It's true, Harry. You do possess many of the qualities Voldemort himself
      prizes. Resourcefulness. Determination. A certain disregard for the rules. Yet the Sorting Hat
      placed you in Gryffindor. 
 Only because I asked it to. 
 Exactly. Which makes you very different from Voldemort. It's not our
      abilities that show what we truly are, Harry. It's our choices. 

      If you want proof that you belong in Gryffindor, Harry, I suggest you look more closely at
      this. 

    
 'Godric Gryffindor.' 
 Only a true Gryffindor could have pulled that out of the Hat.
        

    
 Dobby! This is your Master? The family you serve is the Malfoys! 

    
 Out of my way, Potter. 
 So! You've
      returned! 
 Yes. When the governors heard that Arthur Weasley's daughter had been
      taken into the Chamber, they saw fit to summon me back. 
 Curiously,
      several of them seemed under the impression that you would curse their families if they didn't
      agree to suspend me in the first place, Lucius. 
 From the beginning, my only concern has been the welfare of this school
      and its students. I assume the culprit has been identified. 
 Oh yes. It was Voldemort. Only this time, he chose to act through someone
      else. By means of... this. 

    
 Fortunately, our young Mr. Potter discovered it. 
 One only hopes that no more of Lord Voldemort's old school things find their
      way into innocent hands. The consequences for the one responsible could be... severe.
        

    
 Come, Dobby. We're leaving. 

    
 Sir? I wonder if I could have that. 

    
 Mr. Malfoy! I have something of yours. 

    
 Mine? I don't know what you're talking about. 
 I think you do, sir. I think you slipped it into Ginny Weasley's cauldron that
      day in Diagon Alley. 

    
 Prove it! 

    
 Dobby! Dobby, come! 

      
 Master has given Dobby a sock. Master has presented Dobby with
      clothes. Dobby is... free! 
 What? I didn't -- 

    
 You've lost me my servant! 
 You shall not harm Harry Potter! 

    
 Mark my words, Harry Potter. You'll meet the same sticky end as your
      parents one of these days. They were meddlesome fools too. 

    
 Harry Potter freed Dobby! How can Dobby ever repay him? 
 Just promise me something. 
 Anything, sir. 
 Never try to save my life again. 

    
 You solved it! You solved it! 
 With loads of help from you. 

    
 Welcome back, Hermione. 

    
 Before we begin our feast, let's give a round of applause to Professor
      Sprout and Madame Pomfrey, whose Mandrake Juice has been successfully administered to all
      those who had been petrified. 

    
 Also, in the wake of recent events, as a school treat, all exams have
      been cancelled. 

    
 Oh, no! 

    
 Sorry I'm late. The owl deliverin' my release papers got all lost 'n
      confused. Some ruddy bird named Errol. 

    
 I jus' want to say... that if it wasn't fer' you, Harry... you an' Ron... and
      Hermione... Well, I jus' want to say... Thanks. 
 There's no Hogwarts without you, Hagrid. 
Oh, it's you. 
 What should we do with him, Big D? Harry laughs. 
Big D? Cool name, but to me, you'll always be Ikkle Duddicums. 
Shut up!
Ooo, tough guy. Not so tough in your bed, are you? 
What? 
You boys go home now, or I'll be calling your parents! They pause and
            edge away from Harry. 
I heard you talking in your sleep, last night. Crying. "No, don't kill
            Cedric, don't kill Cedric! Dad, help me, heeelp me! He's going to kill me! Boo-hoo!"
            Dudley's gang laughs. 
Shut up, Dudley. I'm warning you... 
Why should I? Harry whips out his wand and points it at Dudley. 
Because if you don't I'll turn you into the idiot pig you are!
 Don't point that thing at me! 
Not so brave now, are you Duddykins? Now tell your little friends to go
            away. Dudley quivers, then finally complies. 
 G-go home!
Get out of here!
 Don't you ever speak about that again. You
            understand? 
Don't point that thing at me! 
I SAID, DO YOU UNDERS'IAND?!
What's happening? 
Quiet! The stars go out, plunging them into darkness. Dudley yells in
            fear. Harry turns to the end of the street. Gliding as smooth as death over the street,
            tattered robes drifting in the wind, comes a DEMENTOR. 
Dudley! Run!
Come on!
Dudley, no!
Lumos!
'Expecto Patronum!'
 Bow to death, Harry... 
 Haaaaaaaarry!...
What the hell are those? 
Dementors. Petunia kneels on the ground next to Dudley. 
What happened, Duddikins? Vernon turns on Harry, who hastily lowers his
            wand. 
What the hell is a dementoid? Petunia seizes Dudley and attempts to look
            into his mouth. 
They didn't--? 
No. Vernon shoves a large finger at Harry. 
I want some answers! 
We were attacked. 
By those...things? 
They're evil. If they get the chance, they'll suck your soul out through
            your mouth. 
They guard the wizard prison, Azkaban. 
How do you know that? 
Fought 'em off, eh, Dud? Gave 'em the ol' one-two? 
You can't give a Dementor the 'ol one-two.' 
Why is he all right then? 
Because I used magic to save his life! The street-lights die, plunging the
            street into darkness.
Lumos!
Who are all you lot? 
Quiet, Dursley. 
Harry, douse the light. We're exposed here. 
 Nox.
What are you doing here? 
We're your advanced guard, Harry. Dumbledore just sent us as soon as he
            heard about the attack. We're taking you to safety. We're just waiting for the all
            clear. 
How'd he know? It just happened! 
You didn't think Dumbledore'd let you wander around on your own, did you?
            Lupin indicates Tonks. 
Harry, I don't believe you've met Nymphadora Tonks. She smiles at him. 
Tonks, would you go get Harry's broom from the house? She nods and
               departs.
What's been going on? What's Lord Vol- Three of the advanced guard jump. 
We're not talking about it here, it's too risky. Moody's eye stuck
            backwards in his head. 
Blast it.
Mad-eye, dear, you do realize that's disgusting? 
I want 365 degree visibility on the return trip. 
How are we getting there? 
Brooms. Red sparks fly into the air in the distance. Tonks returns with
            the broom, handing it to Harry. 
There's the first signal. 
Right, let's go. 
On your broom, Harry. Moody is moving around them. 
Form up! Form up around Harry. Make it snappy!
We'll be flying in close-quarters formation. Tonks will be right in front
            of you, keep close to her at all times. 
 Don't stop, and whatever
            you do, don't break formation. If any of us are killed, the rest of you, keep flying.
               
 If that were to happen, the survivors, fly to the east. The rear
            guard is standing by. They will find you. 
Stop being so cheerful, Mad-eye. 
We must be ready. This would be the perfect moment for Voldemort to strike
            Harry. 
Uh, is that very likely? 
No one's going to die. Blue sparks blast into the sky. 
There's the second signal! 
Mount your brooms, everyone. Here we go!
The third signal, everyone. Let's go! They kick off from the ground, which
            is swiftly left behind. 
Stay in formation!
We need more height!
Contacts to the south! 
Mad-eye! You, Tonks, and Lupin take Harry! We'll slow them down! The
            rest of the advanced guard peels away from the group. Harry checks the sky around them.
            It appears to be clear. 
There's the other one, Alastor! The other Dementor emerges very close by
            from a cloud. 
Expecto--! 
Harry, leave it to us! And Lupin peels away, rocketing towards the
            Dementor. 
No!
'Expecto Patronum!'
Get Harry to the safe house! 
Come on, Potter! Keep moving! 
But I can help! 
Potter, getting yourself killed won't do a thing. Now move!
We're not far, now!
Did you get rid of them? 
They're gone, Alastor. 
We're there! 
Prepare for descent! Form up around Harry!
Stay here, Harry.
 
 Right, Harry, this way.
Here, read this.
Come on, inside. Hurry. 
Get in, quick, Harry. Don't touch anything. 
Filth! Scum! Half-breeds, mutants, freaks, begone from this place!
            How dare you befoul the house of my fathers?! 
Shut up, you miserable old hag! Quiet! 
Blood traitor, abomination, shame of my flesh! 
Yes, yes, do shut up! He throws the sheet over the picture, and the yells
            die away.
Was that your--? 
Mother, yes. Dear old mum. 
But...why here? 
This house has been my family's for centuries. It's mine now.
               
 I'm the last of the Blacks. I offered it up as headquarters for,
            well, and Dumbledore accepted. It's about the most useful thing I've been able to do for
            a long while. 
Hello, Harry dear. 
Mrs. Weasley! 
Sirius, the meeting is about to start!
 
 Harry, dear, go on upstairs- quietly, if you please. They're all up
            there. Harry looks up the stairs. 
Harry!
Let him breathe, Hermione! 
Oh, Harry! We've missed you! Are you furious with us, I bet you are! 
HERMIONE!
Good to see you, mate. 
Come on, inside. They enter an adjacent bedroom. INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
            They sit down on separate beds. 
Sorry we haven't written, Harry, but Dumbledore made us promise not to. 
We wanted to, mate, we really did, but he thought they would get
               intercepted.
Right. 
He thought you would be safest there. 
Yeah, real safe. Attacked by Dementors, that's safe, that is. 
He was so angry when he heard. It was...scary... 
So, why's he keeping me in the dark? Hermione and Ron look awkward. 
Didn't you bother asking? 
We've only seen him twice, and not for very long. He's really busy. 
So I get to spend the summer with the Dursleys while you two are here. 
It's not that fun, mate. Mum won't let us anywhere near the meetings. 
You've still been here! Hermione and Ron are looking aghast at Harry.
            Harry looks away. There is a silence. 
What's been going on? 
We've already told you, we're not privyed to the meetings. But we do know a
            few things. 
Some of the Order are following known Death Eaters, like Lucious
            Malfoy. 
 And they're guarding something. 
What's this Order everyone's talking about? 
The Order of the Phoenix. Dumbledore started it last time to fight
            You-Know-Who. He only reorganized it after last term. Moments later, MRS. WEASLEY opens
            the door to their room. 
You can come down now, the meeting's over. They stand up to go. INT.
            KITCHEN - NIGHT Harry, Ginny, Hermione, Ron, and Mrs. Weasley enter the KITCHEN, which
            has been set up with long tables and chairs.
Arthur- 
Well, the Ministry is furious with you.
 
 You did magic in front of your muggle cousin. 
 SIRIUS
               
 You'll have to go to an disciplinary meeting tomorrow.
 
 I'm not really hungry. I think I'll go to bed. 
You surprise me, Harry. I figured the first thing you'd do is start
            asking about Voldemort.
I wanted to, but I didn't think you'd tell me anything. 
And that was quite right, Harry! You're much to young-- 
He has a right to know, Molly. 
It's not your decision! 
I know what Dumbledore said, but he needs to know something. 

            
 Yeah. 
He's not a child, Molly. 
He's not an adult either! 
 He's not James. 
 I'm fully aware of who he is, Molly. 
I only have Harry's best interests at heart. 
He's not your son. 
Who else does he have, then? Sirius stands, glaring at Mrs. Weasley. 
He's got me. He's like a son to me.
What do you want to know, Harry? 
Where's Voldemort? What's he doing? 
He's hiding for the moment, because the Ministry is ignoring his return
            and he doesn't want that to change. 
 You really messed things up for him last year,
            Harry. 
How? 
The last person You-Know-Who wanted to alert was Dumbledore. 
And what's his plan? 
He's building up his army again, just like before. 
And you're stopping him from gaining followers? 
We're doing our best, but it's proving to be...difficult. 
You see, when the Ministry of Magic insists that Voldemort isn't back. 
But...why? 
Fudge likes being Minister of Magic. If it turns out that Voldemort came
            back under his watch, he'll be sacked. 
But you're telling people, right? Sirius laughed. 
Well, they think I'm a mass- murderer, Lupin is a werewolf, Tonks and
            Arthur would lose their jobs at the Ministry... 
But Dumbledore is doing all he can. 
If he keeps it up, he might end up in Azkaban. And that would give
            You- Know-Who a clear field to-- 
What? 
You-Know-Who wants something. Something he didn't have last time. A
            weapon. 
What kind of weapon? Lupin and Sirius exchange looks. 
I'm sorry, Harry, we can't say anything more. 
Morning, dear! Did you have a good sleep? 
No, my scar kept hurting. 

            
 Probably just nerves... 
Yeah...nerves... 
Good luck, Harry! She hugs Harry.
They'll have to let you off, Harry... You were defending yourself! I
            checked the laws. 
Thanks, Hermione. 
What does he get a hug for? 
 When you have to go to a disciplinary hearing at
            the Ministry of Magic, I'll hug you too. 
Oh, sure, that's why. 
 Ronald Weasley, are you jealous? 
 Me? Jealous?
            Of course not, it just doesn't seem fair that you hug one friend more than the other, is
            all... 
Would you like a hug? 
 No, I'd hate to force you... Harry grins and shakes
            his head. 
Well, come on, Harry. Time to go. 
Bye. He waves, and he and MR WEASLEY depart. EXT. LONDON STREET - DAY The
            street is not very crowded, as the sun rises in the east.
Good, good, not very many Muggles.
Well, come on Harry, in we go.
I do love using the Fellytone! Now, let's see, what's the number
            again... He punches in SIX, TWO, FOUR, FOUR, TWO.
Welcome to the Ministry of Magic. Please state your business. 
Harry Potter, disciplinary hearing. 
Pleas stand by.
Usually I Apparate, but you're too young, so I thought we'd take the
            scenic route.
Keep close, Harry!
Ah, Perkins, good morn- 
Arthur, they've changed the time of Potter's hearing. 
Blast! Dumbledore thought they might try that. 
It started at eight! 
Good lord, that was five minutes ago! Come on, Harry!
Department of Mysteries. 
Department of Mysteries? 
Yep, I've got no idea what they get up to in here, it's top
               secret.
Come on, Harry! 
I've been there before...
Now, Harry, I find that highly unlikely...
There you are, Harry, in you go...good luck... Harry enters the
            chamber. INT. COURTROOM - DAY One side of the courtroom is an elevated zigarat-shaped
            series of seats carved from black stone.
You're late. 
Er...sorry. 
No matter, the accused will take his seat. Harry does so, glancing
            nervously at the chains on it. 
Very well, we are ready to begin. 
Witness for the Defence, Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore.
            Harry turns in his seat.
Ah...you...er...got our message that the time had changed, did you? 

            
 Must have missed it. 
 However, due to a
            fortunate mistake, I arrived at the Ministry three hours early. 
Well. The...ah...charges. He consults his notes. 
The charges against the accused shall now be read into the record: That
            the accused did with deliberation and fore-knowledge of the illegality of his actions,
            produce a patronus charm in full sight of a Muggle. 

            
 You are Harry James Potter? 
Yes. 
And you conjured a patronus on the night of the eleventh of August? 
Yes, but- 
Within full sight of a Muggle? 
Yes, but- 
You produced a Patronus? A fully- formed Patronus, with a clearly-
            defined shape? 
Yes. 
That is most remarkable, Mr. Potter. 
It doesn't matter how impressive it was! 
But I did it because of the Dementors! 
What do you mean? 
My cousin and I were attacked by Dementors. That's why I had to use the
            Patronus, to drive them away. 
Ah, yes, yes, another cock-and-bull story. 
It's the truth! 

            
 Of course it is. 
Dementors in Little Whinging? 
Oh, come now, Susan. He's clearly lying. 
Actually, we have a witness to the presence of the Dementors in
            question. 
We haven't got time to- 
I may be wrong, but I do believe that it says somewhere in the
            Wizagammot Charter of Rights that the Accused has the right to present witnesses to
            prove his or her case? In fact, I do believe I wrote that particular bit myself. 
Very well. Weasley, fetch the witness. Percy goes to the door and lets
            MRS. FIGG in. She stands in front of Harry and Dumbledore nervously. 
Full name? 
Arabella Doreen Figg, resident of Little Whinging. 
So...what is your story? 
I was sitting on my porch when I saw the two Dementors gliding towards the
            two boys. 
What did the Dementors look like? 
Well, they were big and wore great, tattered cloaks. There is some
            murmuring among the Wizengamot at that. 
Anything else? 
I-I felt them. It was horrible...like I would never be happy again. 
Very well, you may go. 
Not very convincing. 
Oh, I disagree. She described their effects very completely. 
So two Dementors just happen to be in Little Whinging? I think not... 
Only if the Dementors are still taking their orders from only the
            Ministry these days. I believe you know my views on this, Cornelius. 
Yes, and they're nothing but bilge, Dumbledore. 
Excuse me, Dumbledore, but did you just accused the Ministry of Magic
            of ordering an attack on this boy? 
If the Dementors are taking their orders from the Ministry
            exclusively, then it must certainly follow logically that someone in the Ministry
            ordered the attack. 
 And in that case, I'm sure the Ministry will
            make a full inquiry. 
Dementors are irrelevant! 
On the contrary, Cornelius. If they were there, then Harry was acting
            in self-defense, which is perfectly allowable under Clause Seven of the Decree of
            Reasonable Restriction of Underaged Wizardry. 
 We are all in
            agreement on this? 
Well, yes, if he's telling the truth! 
You have heard it from eye- witnesses, Cornelius. 
Very well, all for clearing the accused of charges? He glances around the
            room, noting all the hands in the air. 
All opposed? Only a few hands. 
 Fine! Cleared of all charges! 
Excellent.
Harry, you've been let off! That's wonderful! The door opens again
            and the whole of the Wizengamot exits. 
You were tried by the full court? 
I think so, yeah. 
 Well, no matter. Let's go home.
Er...is Percy mad at you? 
Ah...yes...I'm afraid we had a bit of a row. He, well, he sided with
            Fudge and the rest of us sided with Dumbledore, so Percy left.
Well, well, if it isn't Patronus Potter. 
 The
            Minister here was just telling me how very lucky an escape you just had. Quite
            astonishing...snakelike, in fact. 
What are you doing here? 
Come now, Potter, I really don't think that private matters between the
            Minister and myself are any concern of yours. Lucius moves closer to Harry. 
 All you need to concern yourself about are...your
            dreams, Potter. And Lucius smiles malevolently at Harry. Lucius steps back and turns to
            the Minister. 
Shall we continue this in your office, Fudge? 
Certainly. Harry watches them go. 
If he wanted to talk to the Minister, why down here? 
Dunno, Harry. Some things are just beyond comprehension.

            
 I knew it!
FRED, GEORGE, AND GINNY 
 He got off, he got off, he got off!
            Hermione hugs Harry again. Ron glowers at her. 
Settle down, you three!
Sirius, we saw Fudge talking with Lucius Malfoy on Level Nine again.
            Tell Dumbledore, next time he comes in, would you? 
Yeah, absolutely. 
Well, I'd better be off. I've got a bewitched vomiting toilet to deal
            with. 
George, remember that concept. Vomiting Toilet. 
Right you are, Fred. 
Also, I'm covering for Tonks on guard duty later tonight, so I won't
            be back until late.
Harry!
You all right, Harry? 
Yeah...just...my scar...the pain is getting stronger. Sirius gives a
            worried glance to Lupin, who looks grim. INT. BEDROOM - DAY Harry sits on his bunk,
            thinking. Sirius enters the room, but Harry barely reacts, still gazing into space. 
Harry, I've got something that might interest you.
This was the original Order of the Phoenix. Found it while we were
            cleaning. Harry looks down at all the smiling faces. 
There's Mad-eye and Dumbledore, right next to Dedalus Diggle; Marlene
            McKinnon, she was killed two weeks after this was taken...; 
 SIRIUS
               
 then there's Frank and Alice Longbottom, tortured into insanity
            by Death Eaters; Lupin, of course.. 
 Ah, Edgar Bones, they only ever
            found bits of him; Caradoc Dearborn, he vanished six months later...; Hagrid, of course;
            Gideon and Fabian Prewett, it took five Death Eaters to finish those two off; me, of
            course...; and there they are! Harry watches his parents beam up at him. 
My parents. He watches the picture for a long second. 
I miss them, Sirius... 
I know, Harry, I know. I miss them too. He puts his arm around Harry. 
It's not fair that I got to spend so much time with them and you
            didn't... Harry closes his eyes. 
Why'd they have to die, Sirius, why? 
I don't know, Harry. I wish I did, but I don't... There is a long moment
            of silence. 
I know I'm not your father, Harry, but I'll always be there for you, if I
            can help it... 
Thanks.
 That mudblood with the scar, he cries, why
            does he cry so...? 
Kreacher, get out of here! Now! 
Oh, how the old Mistress would weep to see the traitor in her house...
            The elf exits. 
Who..who was that? 
Kreacher. He's been alone with the house for years, he's gone a bit
            funny. 
 You'd better get some rest. Sirius gets up and exits. Ron
            and Hermione burst into the room seconds later. 
Harry, Ron and I, we've been named House Prefects! She hands Harry a
            letter. There are a few seconds of parchment ripping. 
What about you, Harry? But there is no PREFECT BADGE in Harry's letter.
            He shakes his head. 
Are you sure? I would have thought you would get one! 
I'm sure. Nothing.
So...congratulations Ron, Hermione... 
Well...thanks Harry. 
Come on, lets go back downstairs! 
Yes, do go enjoy yourselves.
What is that? 

            
 What? 

            
 That...that...thing! 
Harry, there's nothing there, mate... 
Yes it is, it's right there! He points. Ron shakes his head. 
I see them too, Harry.
Er...you are? 
Luna. Luna Lovegood. 
Well, thanks Luna.
Hagrid's cabin looks deserted. 
I hope he's all right... 
What if he were still on his...
...what if he's still on his mission from Dumbledore? 
Yeah, could be. Moments later the carriages halt, and the students pile
            out. 
I beg a few moments of your attention, as I have a few start of term
            announcements. Right off, our caretaker, the good Mr. Filch, has reminded me for what he
            says is the four-hundred and sixty-second time that he had an annually updated list of
            various banned items, usually introduced by our humour experts Fred and George
               Weasley...
 ...which are posted in an extensive list on the
            door to Mr. Filch's door. Harry grins at Fred and George. 
Also, we have two staffing changes this year. Professor Grubby-Plank
            will be taking the post of Care of Magical Creatures post as Professor Hagrid is
            on...extended leave. Harry, Ron, and Hermione exchange glances. 
Additionally, we have Professor Umbridge, who has kindly agreed to
            fill the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts- At this, UMBRIDGE stands and clears her
            throat. 
Hem, hem, Headmaster, if I could address the school? Dumbledore looks
            taken aback. McGonogall glares at UMBRIDGE. Dumbledore sits down and invites Umbridge
            forward. 
Thank you, Headmaster. Now, how are we all doing tonight? I thought I
            would just say a few words. I am here at the Ministry of Magic's bequest, under
            Educational Decree twenty-two, which states that if the Headmaster of Hogwarts is unable
            to fill any teaching post the Ministry shall select one for the position.
The Ministry has always considered the magical education of our
            children to be of vital importance, and the passing down of this ancient and noble art
            must be given to the next generation, lest it be lost forever... 

            Without progress, stagnation. But progress for progress's sake is to be discouraged, for
            our art requires no tinkering. 
 A balance must be attained, the new
            and the old, permanence and change, tradition and innovation, order and chaos.
               
 There are large changes coming soon, changes walking the fine
            line between order and chaos. Know only that these changes are for the best, and to
            prevent the destruction of our civilization from its own decay. Thank you.
So why didn't your mum want you to come back to Hogwarts, Seamus? 
What? 
Me mam didn't want me to come back to Hogwarts... 
Why? 
Well...because of you... 
What did I do? 
She...well, she figure's you're, well...you're lying about You-Know- Who
            and Dumbledore's a right nutter... 
Where'd she get that from?
So...she believes this stuff? 
Well...yeah... 
But...but you believe me, don't you? Seamus looks away. Harry turns and
            storms out of the DORM. EXT. HOGWARTS - NIGHT Harry sits on the top of the ASTRONOMY
            TOWER, looking out over the LAKE and the FORBIDDEN FOREST in the distance, Hagrid's hut
            dark and forboding at the edge of the FOREST.
No one believes me, Hedwig. No one...
I'm alone... Hedwig takes off into the night, flying over the castle.
            DISSOLVE 
Sorry, Professor... 
Hmm, let's see, five points from Gryffindor for coming in late. Harry
            frowns, but sits down next to Ron and Hermione. 
Now, as I was saying before Mr. Potter interrupted with his antics,
            your Defense Against the Dark Arts education has been rather fragmented and disjointed
            in your past classes, hasn't it? 
 Know now that this is about to be
            rectified. 

         
 I will be following a pre-approved
            Ministry-prepared, theory-centered Defense lesson plan.
Copy this down.
Yes? 
I wanted to know something about your course aims. 
Well, they should be perfectly self- evident. 
Well, I don't think they are. They say nothing about actually doing
            spells. 
 I can imagine no circumstance in my class where
            you would need to use spells, my dear! 
But surely the whole point of Defense against the dark arts is
            practical application? 
Miss Granger, this class has been approved by Ministry experts. Are you
            a Ministry Expert? 
No, but- 
Then you have no business challenging those who are. We will be
            learning about spells in a safe, risk-free environment- 
But we've got O.W.L.s coming up! You expect us to do the spells with no
            practice? 
What good's theory in the real world? 
This is school, not the real world, Mr. Potter. There is nothing out
            there waiting to get you. 
What about Lord Voldemort? The whole class flinched at the sound of the
            name. 
Ten points from Gryffindor, Mr. Potter. Let me set the record straight.
            She stands behind her desk, leaning on her knuckles. 
Some of you have been told that a certain dead wizard has returned.
            This is a lie.
Mr. Potter, you have just landed yourself in detention!
So, according to you, Cedric Diggory dropped dead? Or are you calling me a
            murderer? 
The boy's death was a tragic accident.
It was MURDER! I saw it happen!
Mr Potter, you have earned yourself a week's worth of detentions! 
Yeah, talk to somebody who cares. Voldemort killed Cedric, and you know
               it.
That goes to Professor McGonogall, dear. Harry rips it from her hand
            and storms out of the room. INT. HALLS - DAY Harry storms down the halls, turns a
            corner, and practically kicks open the door to McGonogall's office. 
Is this true? Did you shout at Professor Umbridge? 
Yeah. But she called me a liar! 
My dear boy, do use your common sense! Umbridge is reporting directly
            to Fudge. She is here to...interfere...with Dumbledore. And things could get much worse,
            trust me. 
 Use caution, always, Potter. Do not mess with Dolorus
            Umbridge, she is dangerous. The Order's hands are tied at Hogwarts, Harry. If you get
            too deep into trouble, we may not be able to get you out. Do you understand? 
Yes, Professor. 
Good. Off you go. 
How can Dumbledore let that horrible woman teach? And when we're taking
            our OWL tests too! 
You reckon she's here to spy on us? 
Well, not us specifically, but definitely Dumbledore and the Order. At
            that moment, ANGELINA JOHNSON comes up to them. 
 Well, way to go, Potter. Your detention is at
            the same time as Quidditch practice! 
Oh! Sorry... 
Yeah, well, you're going to have to get out of it somehow. We're
            holding tryouts for Keeper now Wood's gone, and I wanted to have the whole team there. 
I'll never get out of it, Angelina. 
Well, just...don't do it again! And she storms off. INT. COURTYARD -
            DAY Harry, Ron, and Hermione are heading back inside to the GRYFFINDOR COMMON ROOM. The
            sun is setting in the distance. 
Well, Harry, shall we start on Snape's report? 
Later, I've got detention. 
Good luck, Harry. 
Thanks. 
Ah, Potter. Sit down. Harry sits in a chair right in front of her desk. 
You're going to be doing lines, tonight, Mr. Potter, and you'll be
            using this quill. The QUILL was BLOOD-RED and sinister looking.
You will write "I will not tell lies" until I tell you to stop.
            Understand? 
There's no ink. 
Oh...you won't need ink.
Problem, Potter?
That's enough for this evening. Same time, tomorrow, and we'll see if
            we can get the message to sink in a bit deeper.
Hey, Harry. He looks up from his parchment. 
Have you seen Ron? I can't find him anywhere. Harry shakes his head. 
No, I haven't. 
He's been acting fishy all week. He's up to something. Harry packs up
            his parchments. 

            
 Uh huh.
Another night, another detention. 
That's enough for tonight, Potter. Let's see that hand.
Harry! I tried out for Quidditch Keeper at the tryouts! I'm on the
               team!
Harry--bloody hell!
He's got to be taken to the hospital wing. 
 No. Can't give...Umbridge the satisfaction... 
Umbridge did this? 
You said she was making you do lines! They settle Harry back down. 
She is. But the quill has some sort of spell on it. It uses blood for ink. 
That old hag! She's sick! Hermione looks horrified. 
Oh, Harry. You've got to go to Dumbledore. You can't keep this up. 
No, I'm telling anyone. 
Harry, I really think you should tell-- 
No!
I don't need his help. I don't need anyone's help. He pushes past them and
            limps up into the boys' dorm. 
Hagrid's still not back yet. I hope he's all right. 
I've asked Sirius about it.
Harry, you can't write to him! Owls are being intercepted, it isn't
            safe. 
Don't worry, Hermione, I wrote it in code. Anyway, I figured I need to
            tell someone about Umbridge. My scar hurt again last night in detention. 
Always knew she was a bit fishy. 
You think she's working for You- Know-Who? 
Well, it's a possibility, isn't it? Hermione looks dubious. 
I suppose so. He could have her under the Imperious Curse, though it's
            unlikely. Dumbledore'd know. Harry leans in even closer. 
Yeah, but Dumbledore didn't have a choice, did he? She'd been sent here by
            the Ministry. Hermione unfurls a copy of the Daily Prophet. 
Anything about Harry? 
No, nothing. 
 Wait! Look at this!
 "Trespass at Ministry. Sturgis Podmore has
            appeared before the Wizengamot with charges of trespass and attempted robbery at the
            Ministry of Magic on the 31st of August. He was arrested when found trying to break into
            a top-security door at one in the morning. Podmore was convicted and sentenced to six
            months in Azkaban." 
Sturgis Podmore? 
Wait, he's one of the Order! Hermione glares at Ron. 
Quiet! 
Do you s'pose it was a frameup? They stop talking. Dean Thomas walks by. 
Come on, we'll be late for Charms if we don't hurry. 
Right.
You go on without me. I want to send this. They part ways. 
Hedwig!
 
 Oh...hi. Didn't think anyone else would be up here. She moves to a brown
            school owl. There is an awkward silence. 
Have you found a new Keeper for Quiddich? 
Yeah, my friend Ron Weasley. She ties the package to the owl. 
He any good? 
Well, he made the team. I missed the tryouts. She lets go of the owl and
            it flies out the window. 
Yeah, Umbridge. You were really brave, standing up to her. Harry
            straightens, smiling. 
Yeah...well, it was the truth. The owlry door bursts open again. ARGUS
            FILCH charges in. 
Right, Potter. I'll have what you're sending. 
What? 
I have had a tip-off that you are ordering a large quantity of Dungbombs!
            Now hand it over. 
You're too late, it's gone. Filch looks furious. 
Yeah, I saw him send it. Filch regards her for a moment, then turns back to
            Harry. 
I get a single whiff of a Dungbomb in this castle, Potter...and you're
            mine. He turns and departs.
Um, you weren't ordering dungbombs, were you? 
No. 
I wonder why he'd think you were. 
 Well, see you, Harry.
            She turns and leaves the Owlry. Harry smiles. 
 What a load of rubbish! 
You, ordering dungbombs. I mean, really. 
Yeah, it doesn't make any sense. 
Unless whoever tipped Filch off was interested in reading your mail,
            Harry. I mean, doesn't it seem a little too coincidental that Filch was tipped off when
            you happened to be sending a message to Sirius? Harry looks thoughtful. 
Yeah, that does seem weird. You figure its Umbridge? 
I don't know. Just then Malfoy appears close by. 
Hey, Weasley! Nice job out on the field today! You'll be our best player
            on the pitch! 
Get bent, Malfoy!
No, he's right. I'm useless out there. Complete rubbish. 
It's your first practice. Don't worry about it. Ron looks unusually pale. 
I'm gonna make a fool of myself out there. Harry gasps and rubs at his scar. 
Are you all right, Harry? 
Yeah. Its just...the pain's getting stronger. Ron and Hermione exchange
            glances. 
I don't know how we're ever going to pass our O.W.L.s in Defense
            against the dark arts without any practice! That Umbridge woman is so... She looks at
            Harry and Ron. 
We've got to do something about her. The boys stare at her. 
Yeah, well, poison should do the trick. 
Don't be silly, Ron. Not her, I meant her teaching. We're not going to
            learn anything in that class. 
Yeah, that's true. 
Anyway, I thought we should do it ourselves.
 
 Defense Against the Dark Arts. We'd teach ourselves. 
I don't know...
Hermes?
It's from Percy! 
Read it. 
"Dear Ron, congratulations on becoming a Prefect. For some time I was
            worried you would take the 'Fred and George' route instead of following in my footsteps.
               

         
 You can imagine my relief that this is not the case."
            He looks incredulously at Harry and Hermione. 
Keep reading. 
"Given your attachment to using me as a role model, I will give you a bit of
            advice from one respecter of authority to another. 
 It is likely
            that you have been seeing quite a lot of Harry Potter of late. I must recommend you
            break ties with that boy as soon as possible. He may be Dumbledore's favorite, but
            Dumbledore may not be in charge at Hogwarts much longer. Your loyalties should lie with
            the Ministry of Magic, not Dumbledore and Potter's personality cult.
               
 Please do not fear breaking ties with Potter. If trouble
            arrises, go to Dolores Umbridge, a truly delightful woman. 
 I hope
            you will carefully consider my advice to you, Ron. Don't let the dangerous errors of
            Dumbledore, Potter, and unfortunately our parents lure you into destroying a perfectly
            good career. Percy." Ron looks up, aghast. 
Well, if you want to, ah, "break ties" with me, I swear I won't get
            violent. Ron tears the letter in half. 
He is the world's biggest git! He hurls the pieces into the fireplace. 
Watch it!
 Sirius?
 Right you are. Got you letter and though we should talk in person.
            
 What was that?
Letter from Percy. 
Yeah, full of the usual rubbish. 
Except he did mention that Dumbledore might not be in charge here much
            longer. 
It doesn't surprise me. Fudge wants Dumbledore out. 
Why? 
He's worried Dumbledore is trying to turn the students against the
            Ministry. 
Well, that would explain why Umbridge isn't teaching us anything useful
            in Defense Against the Dark Arts. 
Exactly. The Ministry doesn't want you trained in combat. 
What does he think Dumbledore is going to do, raise an army? 
That's exactly what he's worried about. Fudge is getting more paranoid
            about Dumbledore every day. There is a nervous silence in the room. 
What do you know about Umbridge? 
She's a nasty piece of work. Apparently she hates part-humans. 
Could she be a Death Eater? 
The Order seriously doubts it. She's no picnic, but she's no Death Eater
            either. 
But she's evil. 
The world isn't split into the Order and the Death Eaters, Harry. Harry
            sits back, looking unsatisfied. 
As to your question about Hagrid, well, no one is really sure what
            happened to him, actually. He was supposed to be back a while ago. 
What? 
Dumbledore's not worried about him, though. Hagrid's tough. He'll be all
            right. 
But if he was supposed to be back by now... 
Look, asking questions about him will only make it more obvious that he's
            not back.
Get out of here!
I cannot believe it! Harry and Ron glance at her. She slaps the paper
            down on the table. 
 "Ministry Passes Educational Decree Number
            Twenty-Three: Dolores Umbridge Appointed Hogwarts High Inquisitor"? He looks at Harry
            and Hermione. 
What's that mean? 
It says here that the High Inquisitor has the power to inspect all of
            the teachers. 
You're kidding! 
That's not all. The High Inquisitor also has the power to sack teachers
            as well. Fred and George march by. 
So, seen the news have you? 
Personally, I envy you three. 
Why's that? 
Umbridge is inspecting McGonagall in your period. That old toad won't
            know what hit her. He looks at Fred wistfully. 
Oh, to be a youth again, to experience the innocent glee of watching
            Umbridge be destroyed by the greatest Head of Gryffindor this century. 
Well, we'll expect a full report after. 
Complete with facial expressions. And they wander off. 
Greetings my children. I sense even now that many of you have already
            made the transition into the beyond! Umbridge smiles, toad-like. 
Today we will be continuing our interpretation of prophetic dreams.
            Please divide into your groups and discuss your recent night time visions using the text
            as a guide.
And how long have you been at this post? 
Near to sixteen years I have been the guide to young seers possessed
            of the Inner sight. Umbridge makes a note. 
I understand you are the descendent of the famous Seer Cassandra
               Trelawney?
 
 And you are the first since Cassandra to have the Second Sight? 
These things tend to skip...several...generations. 
Of course. She makes another note. 
Now, if you would kindly make a prediction for me? Trelawney seems to
            swell with indignation. 
The Inner Eye does not See upon command!
My dear boy, your dream diary, if you please!
My dear boy! My poor boy! These dreams are evil portends! Harry looks
            at the page. 
 "Dreamt I was at breakfast eating oatmeal"?
Yes, yes, oatmeal! Are you telling me you cannot see the signs? The
            foretelling of suffering and death? 
Er... 
Perhaps you are not as in the beyond as the others. She sweeps from
            Harry's table. 
Well, if that's the best you can do, Professor, I will be going. 
Where are we going, Hermione?
There we are. 
"The Hog's Head," Hermione? She leads them towards it. 
Come on, I'll explain in a minute. 
Hermione, what's going on? 
These are some people I mentioned my Defense Against the Dark Arts idea
            with. She sits down. Harry and Ron follow. 
You mean about us teaching ourselves? 
Hey, Harry. 
Hey, Neville. 
 It's good to see that the horned snorkle-stacks
            haven't gotten you yet, Harry. Harry looks confused for a moment. 
Uh...same to you, Luna. Hermione beats on the table to quiet everyone. 
Hi, everyone. I thought it would be good if we met and talked over how
            we wanted to teach ourselves Defense Against the Dark Arts. 
 Because
            we need to learn it properly, not the rubbish Umbridge is doing. 
Hear, hear! 
Obviously, this will help us pass our O.W.L.s, but more importantly, it
            gives us the ability to protect ourselves from...Lord Voldemort.
That's the first time you've said his name. Hermione looks pleased. 
How do we know You-Know-Who's really back? 
Dumbledore believes he is. 
That's true, but I think we're drifting from the purpose-- 
It's okay, Hermione. He looks at the crowd. 
I believe Voldemort's back because I fought him last year. Dumbledore's
            already told the school that. If you didn't believe him you won't believe anyone. There
            is a tense silence. 
Well...anyway...uh, I think that in order to learn properly we'll need
            a teacher. 
But we're all students. None of us has the experience to-- 
Someone here does.
Me? 
I for one would like to know why Potter's qualified and the rest
            of us aren't. 
 Well, he's only confronted You-Know- Who
            himself four times and lived to talk about it. 
One of the portraits said you'd killed a Basilisk in the Chamber of
            Secrets with that sword in Dumbledore's office. 
Uh...well, yeah, I did. 
Blimey, Harry... Half the crowd looks awestruck. 
Wow... 
Can't forget that he saved the Sorcerer's Stone from You-Know-Who in his
            first year.
And last year he got through the Triwizard Tournament! There are mutters of
            agreement. 
Not to mention you dueled with You- Know-Who all alone and he still couldn't
            kill you! 
And you fought off those dementors that attacked you this summer. Hermione
            looks tremendously pleased. 
So all in favor of taking lessons from Harry?
Where are we going to meet? 
What about an unused classroom? 
That might work. I'll look into that. 
Ok, good.
I think we should put our names down, so we know who was here. Suddenly
            people look uncomfortable. 
I don't know...if it were found...I mean, Umbridge wouldn't like what
            we're doing... 
Honestly, Ernie, do you think I'd just leave it lying around? Besides,
            its enchanted.
Also, what should we call ourselves? 
What about the Anti-Unbridhe League? 
We need something that doesn't give away what we're doing. 
I think it should be Dumbledore's Army. There is excited agreement. Harry
            smiles at her. 
Dumbledore's Army it is, then. The D.A. for short. Fred and George
            stand, along with Lee. 
We'll let you know when we're going to meet. The meeting breaks up.
         
I think that went well. 
Yeah. 
And did you see Cho, Harry? 

            
 What about her? 
Well, she couldn't keep her eyes off you, could she?! Harry gives a
            little smile. 
Harry, you won't believe...that Umbridge woman...this is too much!! 
What's she done now? 
Follow me. 
"By order of the Hogwarts High Inquisitor: All student organizations,
            societies, teams, groups, and clubs are henceforth disbanded. Permission to reform must
            be approved by High Inquisitor Umbridge. No student organization can exist without the
            knowledge and approval of the High Inquisitor. Any student found to be a part of an
            illegal organization will be expelled immediately." Angelina is furious just looking at
            it again. 
She refused to allow us to reform the Gryffindor team. We had to go to
            Dumbledore to get her to allow it. Harry is extremely angry. 
Not only that, but what about the D.A.? 
This isn't a coincidence. He looks at Ron and Hermione. 
 She knows.
She can't!
 Look, we don't know how many people could have overheard our meeting
            and told her. 
Or somebody at the meeting could have blabbed to her. 
No, they couldn't have. The parchment we all signed was enchanted, like
            I said. No one can betray the D.A. without us knowing. Harry stops pacing and grins at
            Hermione. 
What would we do without you, Hermione? She beams at him.
 
 She's hurt! Hedwig hoots softly. 
She doesn't look very good. 
Harry, you'd better take her to Professor Grubby-Plank. She'll know
            what to do. Harry scoops Hedwig up and runs through the portrait hole. 
Potter! He stops and turns to her. 
Where on earth are you going at this time of night? 
It's Hedwig. I think she's been attacked. 
What?
Yes, I think you might be right, Potter. She looks at Harry. 
Where was she coming from? 
London. He gives her a significant look. She nods. 
Well, give her to me. I'll run her down to Professor Grubby-Plank.
            Harry hands Hedwig to her. She takes the owl carefully. 
There you are.
Bear in mind, Potter, that channels of communication in and out of
            Hogwarts are being watched, won't you? 
Yes, Professor. 
Good. Now, off to bed.
Mr. Harry Potter! Harry turns to see Dobby standing in the middle of the
            room. 
Dobby! What are you doing here? 
Dobby is cleaning, sir. He seemed to want to say something more. 
What is it, Dobby. 
Dobby...Dobby wishes he could help Harry Potter. Dobby has heard him
            muttering in his sleep. 
Don't worry about it, Dobby. But I don't think you can help me. Dobby's
            ears droop.
Actually, there is something you can do, Dobby. Dobby brightens instantly. 
I need a room where twenty-eight people can practice Defense Against the
            Dark Arts without the teachers knowing. Especially Professor Umbridge. Dobby leaps into
            the air and claps his hands. 
Dobby knows of the perfect place, Harry Potter! It is the Room of
            Requirement, sir. You can only use the room in times of great need. Whatever you need
            will be there for you, Harry Potter. 
That's brilliant, Dobby! Dobby looks pleased. 
Dobby can show you now, if you wish, Harry Potter. Harry thinks for a
            moment. 
Better not, Dobby. School is pretty intense right now. We'll do it in a
            few months, before the holidays. 
...and Slytherin is up forty to ten. Alica with the quaffle!
Weasley is our King, Weasley is our King, He always lets the Quaffle
            in, Weasley is our King!
Just ignore them, Ron! Ron does not acknowledge him.
 Another ten points to Slytherin. The score is now
            fifty-ten in favor of Slytherin. Malfoy pulls up on his broom near Ron as well. 
I should thank you, Weasley. You're definitely our best player!
Harry, are you all right? He is helped to his feet by Fred and George. 
Bet you loved that, Potter! Saved Weasley's neck, didn't you? The
            Gryffindors ignore him. 
I've never seen a worse Keeper! Maybe we should add some more verses to
            our little song. About his filthy mother! George tries to leap at Draco. Harry and Fred
            hold him back. 
And his pathetic loser of a father too!
But then, you like the Weasleys, don't you? How can you stand the stink? I
            guess it reminds you of your own dear mother!
Impedimenta!
 What on earth do you two think you're
               doing?
Don't make me stupify you, Potter!
My office. Now. 
In all my thirty-nine years at this school, I have never seen such a
            disgusting display. 
Malfoy provoked us. 
Of course he wanted to provoke you! He'd just lost! She stares at
            both of them. 
I cannot express in words the disappointment I feel right now.
What is it, Dolores? 
I thought you might need some additional authority in dealing with
            these two. 
You thought wrong. Now kindly remove yourself from my office. She
            turns back to George and Harry. 
Now, I don't care what Malfoy said. Your performance out there was
            shameful. Fifty points from Gryffindor, and I'm giving you both a week's worth of
            detentions. 
I hardly think that's an adequate punishment for this. She holds up a
            parchment. 
Educational Decree Twenty-Five. It gives me, as High Inquisitor, the
            power to give punishments and privileges, and to alter those given out to students by
            other members of the staff. She turns to Harry and George. 
So, I think a life-long ban from playing quidditch should do the trick
            for both of these. Oh, and this one's twin as well. He was going to attack Malfoy as
            well. Harry and George are stunned. 
Ban us...for life. 
Yes, indeed, Mr. Potter. She moves towards them. 
Ah, I'll take your brooms as well. She confiscates the brooms too. 
Well, have a wonderful day. She sweeps from the office. Harry looks to
            McGonagall. 
You've--! 
My hands are tied, Potter. 
I can't believe it...three players banned for life in one day... 
I'm going to resign. Harry is slumped low in a chair. 
You can't! 
I'm horrible! I should never have joined. 
If you quit, we'll be out four players! Ron looks miserable. 
This is the worst day of my life. Hermione is staring out of the window. 
I know something that could cheer you up. 
Hermione, give it up. 
Hagrid's back! 
Hagrid, what happened to you? 
I've fine, I tell yeh! 
Come off it, Hagrid! We're not blind! 
Was it because of the giants? There is a silence. 
Can' answer tha', I'm afraid. Top secret, that is. Business of the Order. 
We know you were looking for giants, Hagrid. Dumbledore said so last year. 
Oh. Well, yeah, I was, then. Went with Madame Maxime. Took us a month to
            get to their camp. 
A month? 
O' course! Can' do magic, not with the Ministry followin' us all the way.
            Plus, giants aren't fond o' wizards. Don' trust 'em. 
So what did you do when you found them? 
Waited 'till mornin' an' then marched righ' in. 
 We gave 'em a gift, jus' like Dumbledore said. Gave
            'em a branch o' Gubraithian fire, Everlasting Flame. 
 Giants love
            magic, see, jus' not too fond o' wizards. Nuthin' a giant loves better than
               magic.
 What happened then? 
 We sat down, an' had a talk. Well, mostly they
            listened good. But there were good signs. 
 Well, they did 'till tha'
            night. Tha's when everythin' went wrong.
 There were a coup. Nex' mornin' there were a new
               chief.
 We went back ter see what we could do with this new
               chief.
 An' then things got even worse. Death Eaters arrived,
            an' the new chief were all happy ter be seein' them!
 We figured, jus' cause some o' the giants were
            favorin' You-Know-Who don't mean all of 'em were. The coup ha' driven the ol' chief's
            supporters into some caves, so we wen' in after 'em. Maxime and Hagrid walk into a dark
            cave, wands glowing. 
 You went into caves looking for giants? 
 We foun' enough, an' they seemed interested--at
            first. Then the new chief's lot raided the caves. Tweren't many survivors, an' none o'
            them wanted anythin' to do with us after tha'. 
So...no giants are coming? 
Well, not righ' away. We brought our message, an' I expec' a fair few'll
            remember it afore teh end comes. 
Glad to see all of you could find this place all right. 
Hey, Harry, what is all this stuff?
Loads of Defense Against the Dark Arts equipment. Hopefully we'll be able
            to get to all of it before the end of term. He paces in front of them. 
You need to understand something before we start, though. Defending
            yourself from the Dark Arts has less to do with magical ability and more to do with
            thinking fast and a lot of luck. 
 We'll be doing Expelliarmus
            tonight, though hopefully we can move on to other things if we have time. 
Oh please. Professor Lockhart taught us that in second year. 
Lockhart didn't teach as much as prune himself. 
Besides, it works. I used it against You-Know-Who last June. It saved my
            life. Zacharias falls silent. 
Right. Well, let's split into pairs and give it a go. 
Expelliarmus! Ron's wand flips from his hand across the room. 
Well done, Neville! He shouts down the others. 
Look here, you lot! Neville's really got the hang of this one. 
 Go ahead again. Fred tosses Ron's wand to him. Neville swirls his
            wand. 
Expelliarmus! Ron's wand does it again. 
I did it! I did it! Harry claps him on the shoulder. 
Never forget this spell, Neville. It could save your live some day. He
            moves to the front of the room again. 
Okay, everyone. We've done a lot today, and I've seen some great
            improvement. That's it for now. We'll meet back here, same time next week!
What's wrong with him?
Get McGonagall! Go! Neville turns and runs out of the dorms. 
Harry! HARRY!
Potter!
Wake up, Potter. Wake up. Please... Harry's eyes open. He sits up,
            looking frantic. 
Mr. Weasley's been attacked! 
You dreamed this, Potter? 
No, I saw it happen! I...I was there... Ron is looking pale. 
You're sure this happened, Potter? 
 Yes! We've got to do something or he will die! 
We're going to see the Headmaster, Potter. 

            Weasley, you'd best come too. 
Professor McGonagall, and...ah...
What can I do for you? 
Well, Potter has had some kind of nightmare... 
It wasn't a nightmare! Well, I was asleep, but it wasn't a normal dream.
            It was...well, real. I saw, well--Mr. Weasley has been attacked by a giant snake. Ron is
            looking very pale. 
How did you see this? How were you positioned when you saw it? 
Oh. Uh...I was the snake. I saw it from the snake's perspective. 
Is Arthur seriously injured? 
Yes!
You were listening? 
Naturally. 
Raise the alarm. We must make sure Arthur is found by the right
               people.
Many of our previous headmasters and mistresses have portraits in
            other institutions, allowing them to move between them. He motions for all of them to
            sit. They sit. Dumbledore moves to Fawkes. 
Fawkes, we will need a warning. The PHOENIX vanishes in a blast of
               fire.
Naturally, naturally. 
 But in essence divided?
            Harry and Ron exchange confused looks. Everard returns to his portrait. 
What news? 
I shouted until someone came. They carried him up seconds ago. He
            doesn't look good. Covered in blood... Dilys returns to her portrait at this time. 
Dumbledore, I've just seen them arrive at St. Mungos. Apperated there
            moments ago. He looks really bad. 
Good. 

            

         
 Minerva, the rest of the Weasleys will need to
            be awoken. She nods and departs. Dumbledore again turns to the portraits hanging on the
            wall. 
Phineas. 
Phineas, I need you to visit your other portrait. Tell Sirius what
            happened and that we are coming to stay for a while. 
It's late, Dumbledore... Dumbledore stares at him. 
I'm going, I'm going... He vanishes. Dumbledore takes a black pot and
            taps it with his wand. 
"Portus." McGonagall returns with Ginny, Fred, and George in tow. 
Harry, what's happening-- 
Your father has been injured in the course of his work for the Order.
            He is alive and arrived at St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries only
            moments ago. He picks up the pot and steps around the desk. 
We, however, are going to Sirius's house until the morning. We're
            merely waiting for Phineas to return.
Fawkes's warning. Umbridge knows you're out of bed. Minerva, head her
            off. Tell her anything you can think of. McGonagall departs again. Phineas returns to
            his portrait. 
He says he'd be delighted. Dumbledore beckons everyone over to him. 
We're going by Portkey. They all grab the pot, and VANISH. 
There you are.
We've got to go to St. Mungo's. 
No, you can't. 
We can go where we please. 
We can't go yet. It would look to suspicious if you lot showed up fifteen
            minutes after Arthur arrives because Harry's been seeing visions of things happening
            hundreds of miles from Hogwarts.
That's our father out there dying! 
I can't let you leave. I'm sorry.
You don't even care! You wouldn't even understand! Sirius stares at him
            incredulously. 
I was part of the first Order. I lost my best friends to You-Know- Who.
            His eyes flick to Harry. 
He's all I have left of them. Believe me, I don't want Arthur to die.
               
 But there are some things worth dying for!
Mum! 
Your father's alive. He's going to make it. There is relief
            evident on all of their faces. Harry turns and leaves, re-entering the kitchen. 
Sirius, I-- He stops. Sirius looks at him. 
You can tell me, Harry. 
When I saw the attack, well, I was the snake.
 
 I felt the fangs like they were mine, saw through the snake's eyes like
            they were mine... Sirius looks concerned. 
I think I might be going mad. There is a horrible silence. Sirius looks
            uncomfortable. 
Nonsense. You're just tired. You've had a rough night. 
But what if there's a snake inside me? 
You've told Dumbledore this? 
 Then there's
            nothing to worry about. 
We're here to see Arthur Weasley.
This way, come on! 
We'll wait outside at first, Molly. It should be family first.
Don't be silly, Harry. You too. And she ushered him inside. 
Hullo, everyone! Mrs. Weasley bends down and kisses Arthur. 
How are you, dear? 
I am absolutely fine. If they could take the bandages off, I'd walk out
            of here in a jiffy. He hugs Ginny with his good arm. 
How come they haven't taken them off, then? 
Oh, I start bleeding like mad. The snake had some strange poison in it.
            Keeps the wounds open. But they'll find a cure, don't you doubt. George leans in close. 
What were you doing when it happened, dad? 
That's my own business. 
You were guarding it, weren't you? This weapon thing? 
That's enough! She looks at Arthur. 
Moody and Tonks are outside, Arthur. They'd like a word. She looks
            at her children. 
All of you, out, if you please. They turn and leave. Mr Weasley
            calls Harry back. 
Harry, stay a moment. Harry returns to the bed. 
I never thanked you properly. 
There's no need-- 
But there is, Harry. If you hadn't had your vision, no one would have
            found me in time. So...thank you. Harry smiles, then departs. 
...we searched the whole floor, Arthur, but we couldn't find that snake.
            Why a snake, anyway? 
He probably sent it as a lookout. See what he's up against. That's the
            closest he's ever gotten to it. 
 So, Potter says he saw the whole
            thing? 
Yes. You know, Dumbledore seems like he's been waiting for
            something like this to happen. When I spoke to him this morning, he seemed very worried
            about Harry. 
He should be. I mean, if You-Know- Who is really possessing him... Moody
            trails off. 
 They turn.
 Professor Lockhart! Lockhart looks puzzled. 
Professor? Me? Did I really? Well, I expect I was hopeless at it! He
            rubs his hands together briskly. 
Now, I'll expect all of you will be wanting my autograph? 
Uh, sure... Just then, a HEALER emerges from a DOUBLE-DOOR nearby. 
Ah, there you went, Gildroy. She comes up to them and gently takes his
            elbow. 
He keeps wandering off, handing out autographs, don't you know? It's a
            good sign toward recovering his memory, the poor dear. 
Yeah, sorry about that, mate. Lockhart peers at him. 
Have we met? 
Yeah, it was my wand that backfired on you. 
Was it? What a coincidence!
This is our long-term resident ward, for permanent spell damage. Well, I
            must go... She bustles away. 
Come along, Neville. Harry and the others turn. 
Hey, Neville! Neville turns beet-red, and looks away. His GRANDMOTHER looks
            at the three of them. 
Friends of yours, Neville? 
 Ah, yes, Harry
            Potter. Good to meet you, finally. And a Weasley. She turns to Hermione 
And you must be Miss Granger. Neville's mentioned you. 
Who're you visiting, Neville? Mrs. Longbottom turns to Neville. 
You haven't told them? 
Told us what? 
Neville's dear parents were tortured into insanity by You-Know-
            Who before he disappeared. Aurors, you know, very well respected.
I never knew...Poor Neville. 
Are you all right, Harry dear? You look like you're going to be
               sick.
Running away, are we? He turns to the portrait of Phineas. 
I have to. 
You know, I thought Gryffindors had to be brave. 
I won't hurt anybody else. 
I see. You are running away out of nobility. You know, that's why I
            hated teaching. Young people always think they know what's best, as if no one else could
            possibly understand things better. 
 
I've brought a message from Dumbledore. Harry stops and looks at him. 
What is it? 
Dumbledore says, 'Stay where you are.' 
That's it? Stay there while the grown-ups sort things out? 
When in all your life has listening to Dumbledore ever led you into
            trouble? Whatever his reasons, he has your best interests at heart, Potter. Phineas
            moves off the portrait frame and vanishes. 
Fine! Go! And tell Dumbledore thanks for nothing! 
 
 Get out!
 No. 
 Ginny, I'm dangerous. You can't be around me. 
Did you forget that I've been possessed by You-Know-Who before? 
 
I forgot. 
Lucky you. Anyway, that's what I wanted to talk to you about.
               
 Can you remember everything you've done this year? There aren't
            any blank spots in your memory? 
No, I don't think so. 
Then You-Know-Who has never possessed you, Harry. She sits down on the bed
            next to him. 
I don't know what's going on with you right now, but possession's not one
            of them. You're not dangerous. 
 

            
 Thanks, Ginny. 
Don't mention it. 
 
Harry, have you seen Kreacher? I haven't seen him for days now. 
Haven't seen him. 
Oh well. Maybe he's crawled up into the air ducts and died...mustn't get
            my hopes up though. 
 
Potter, excellent. I'd like a word. He marches over to the table and sits. 
Sit, Potter. 
You know, I don't like people giving orders in my house. 
How unfortunate for you. Now kindly get out. My instructions from
            Dumbledore are to talk with Potter alone. 
I'm his godfather. I think I'll stay. 
 
Very well, then. I know how you like to pretend you're useful. Sirius
            stiffens, but ignores the jab. 
It is the Headmaster's wish that I teach you Occlumency, Potter. 
What's that? Snape sneers. 
Occlumency. It is an ancient form of magic that allows you to defend your
            mind from external intrusion. 
 We begin at six-o-clock on Monday,
            Potter. Snape stands. 
Well, unlike Sirius here, I don't have unlimited leisure time. 
Just a second, Snape. If I hear that you're using this to give Harry a
            hard time, you'll have me to answer to. Snape sneers again. 
How touching. Yet Potter is incredibly like his father. Criticism simply
            bounces off of him.
I've warned you, Snivellus. Dumbledore may think you've reformed, but I
            know better... Snape pushes him out of the way. 
Touch me one more time, Black, and you won't touch anything again. He
            sweeps back to the door and departs. 
 Hi, Harry.
 There is an awkward silence. 
Er...bye then. She starts to walk by. 
Hey Cho! She turns to him. 
Well, uh, Valentine's Day is the same day as our next Hogsmead visit. She
            blushes harder. 
Well, uh, would you like to, you know, go with me? 
 Sure!
 She smiles at him and walks away. 
Sit, Potter. Harry does so. 
As you are well aware, I will be teaching you Occlumency. The headmaster
            feels you should learn this form of magic to defend yourself against the Dark Lord, who
            is skilled at Legilimency. 
What's that, Professor? 
Legilimency is the ability to extract thoughts and feelings from others. 
Voldemort can read minds? 
As usual, you have all the subtlety of a stone wall, Potter.
               

         
 The mind is not a book, of which any page can be
            examined. The mind is complex and multi-layered. 
So he could read our minds right now? 
Eye contact is normally required for Legilimency to work. In your case,
            however, things are somewhat different. Your scar has forged a connection between you
            and the Dark Lord. 
 When your mind is most relaxed, such as during
            sleep, you receive the Dark Lord's thoughts and feelings. The Headmaster believes that
            it is inadvisable for this to continue. 
But hasn't it helped so far? I mean, it saved Mr. Weasley's life, didn't
            it? 
Yes, it did, but at the expense of our advantage. The connection between
            you was so powerful during your vision of the snake that the Dark Lord became aware of
            it. The Headmaster fears that he may try to use this to his advantage, to manipulate you
            through false visions.
Wand out, Potter. Harry draws his wand. 
You may use any spell you can think of to try and repel me. 
What are you going to do? 
I am going to break into your mind. 
 Legimens! The
            spell hits Harry, who staggers backward, grimacing. 
NO!
Well, you stopped me eventually. Ideally, you should repel me with your
            mind. Harry climbs to his feet. 
Clear your mind, Potter. Abandon your emotions. Legilimens! Harry staggers
            again. 
Come on, Harry! 
I've been there before...
Now, Harry, I find that highly unlikely... 
What was that? Harry looks stunned. 
I've just realized... Snape is staring at him, agitated. 
Realized what, Potter? Harry looks at Snape suddenly. 
What's in the Department of Mysteries, sir?
What did you say? 
That corridor, I've been dreaming about it for months...it leads to the
            Department of Mysteries, I'm sure of it.
There are many things in the Department of Mysteries, Potter, none of
            which concern you. There is a horrifying SCREAM that ECHOS through the castle.
 You cannot sack me! 
I can do whatever I wish! 
This is my home! Umbridge is grinning evilly. 
Not anymore. She points at the door with a stubby finger. 
Now remove yourself from this castle! 
She will not be leaving.
I have the authority, Headmaster! 
Oh, I agree with you, Professor Umbridge. You do have the power to
            dismiss my teachers. However...
...You cannot send them from this castle. That is still my decision.
            Professor Trelawney will remain here. Umbridge turns to him, furious. 
And what of her quarters when I appoint a new teacher. 
Happily, that will not be necessary. I have found a successor for
            good Professor Trelawney already. As you know... Umbridge is looking mutinous. 
...the Ministry can only appoint new teachers if I cannot find one. I
            think you will find him suitable enough.
This is Firenze.
So you're saying this weapon You- Know-Who's after is in the Department of
            Mysteries? 
It's got to be. 
That's got to be what Surgis Podmore was doing in the Ministry when he
            was arrested. 
Probably. Mr. Weasley was probably there when he was attacked, too. That
            must be what the Order's guarding! 
But why the Department of Mysteries? 
It makes perfect sense, Ron. It's got to be something the Ministry's
            been developing. Something top secret. Harry nods in agreement. Hermione picks up a copy
            of the Daily Prophet grimly. 
Look at this. There's been a mass escape from Azkaban. 
Bloody hell!
They're all Death Eaters!
Yes. Harry grits his teeth. 
Voldemort. 
Hi, Harry! Harry grins sheepishly at her, avoiding looking at Ron. 
Have fun, Harry. Meet me in The Three Broomsticks after. There's
            something you need to do. 
Ok. He goes to Cho, and they leave together. 
You know, Cedric and I came here last year. Before...
I--I've been meaning to ask you for ages...but...I mean... Harry looks at
            her. She is beginning to tear up. 
What? 
Did--did Cedric say anything about me before he...he--died? 
Oh. Uh, no, there wasn't really much time... Cho bursts into tears. Harry
            tries to console her. 
Look, maybe we should talk about something else... 
I thought you'd want to talk about it! I thought you'd understand!
See you around, Harry. She walks out. Harry stands and runs after her. 
What's this all about? 
That's what Little Miss Perfect was about to tell us. Harry glances at
            Hermione. 
Right, well, I figured that with all of the negative press out about
            Harry, he should have a chance to defend himself. 
 All of the
            details. What happened last summer. The truth about Sirius Black and Voldemort, not to
            mention the names of all the Death Eaters still on the loose. Rita leans across the
            table. 
The Prophet will never publish that. Goes against the public mood. 
Well, it doesn't matter. We've found a publisher for the article. 
Who? Luna looks away from the window. 
My father. He's the editor of The Quibbler. Rita laughs out loud. 
The Quibbler? 
 You think people will take Harry
            Potter seriously if he's published in the Quibbler? It's nothing but a conspiracy
            theory, cock-and-bull story tabloid! 
Some won't believe Harry, that's true. But every person we do convince
            is one more ally. Rita shrugs, and pulls her quill from her bag. 
So, Harry. Ready to tell the public the truth? 
Yeah, I guess so. Hermione sits back and sips her drink. 
Fire away, Rita. 
Look, Harry! It's your article!
What on earth? Hermione beams at him. 
Fan mail, Harry! Responses to the article. 
Which article is that, dear?
I have just published an article telling the real story about what
            happened last June. Umbridge instantly turns an ugly shade of purple in her rage. 
Where is this article? Hermione hands her the Quibbler. 
Right, I will confiscate this. Anyone found in possession of this
            magazine will be expelled. She stalks off. Hermione giggles in triumph. 
What? 
She's done it to herself. Banning the article will only make people
            want to read it more! 
We've been doing so well, I thought we'd work on some defensive blocking
            spells tonight. 
That was really good. With a CRACK, Dobby appears. 
Mr. Harry Potter! He looks absolutely frantic. Harry turns to him. 
What is it, Dobby?
She--
Who, Dobby? Dobby shakes his head. 
Is it Umbridge? Dobby nods. Harry looks up, horrified. Dobby forces his
            arms down and takes a breath. 
She knows, Harry Potter. She's coming! Harry opens the door with a wave of
            his wand. 
Get out of here! Now!
Got you, Potter. 
 Over here, Professor! I've got
               one!
It's him. Well done, Draco! 
 On your feet,
            Potter. We're going to see the Headmaster! She turns to Draco. 
Search everywhere for the others, Draco. Round them all up. Check
            everywhere, bathrooms, the library, empty classrooms. We must find them! Draco nods and
            hurries off. 
You may be High Inquisitor of this school, Professor Umbridge, but
            kindly do not manhandle my students.
Well, well, well, Mr. Potter! I expect you know why you're here?
Not really, no. 
You don't? You haven't broken any school rules? 
School rules? No. 
Or Ministerial Decrees? 
Not that I know of.
I'm afraid the poor girl is unable to speak. But I shall tell you what
            has transpired. 
 Shortly after dinner she came to me and said that
            if I went to the Room of Requirement I would find an illegally-formed student group.
               
 It was at that time that this hex took affect. She gestures to
            Marietta's face. 
Since I had received information some time ago that Potter and a number
            of other students had met in the Hog's Head to start an illegal group-- 
I'm not sure that's true, Professor.
 
 In point of fact, when young Potter met those students it was not
            illegal. 
But two days later, Educational Decree Twenty-Four was introduced. 
Again, quite correct. However, I wonder if you have any evidence that
            proves this group has been meeting since then? 
I have a witness right here! 
Correct again. I must confess that I was, however, under the
            impression that this young girl only told you a meeting was going on tonight. 
Let's ask her, shall we? She turns to Marietta, who is staring at the
            wall. 
You can shake your head for an answer, dear. Now, have there been more
            meetings? Slowly, still staring at the wall, Marietta shakes her head. 
What do you mean by shaking your head, girl? 
I would think that she was saying there have been no other meetings.
            Would that be correct?
But what about Potter? He was the leader, and has been--
Why are you shaking your head, girl? 
It usually means 'no,' Dolores. Umbridge grabs Marietta by the cloak
            and shakes her roughly.
Again, I cannot have you manhandling my students, Professor Umbridge.
            She laughs, softly, and lets Marietta go. 
My apologies, Headmaster. I forgot myself. 
Well, what about the meeting tonight? 
Right. Of course. Well, we proceeded down to the Room and entered.
               
 We caught Potter just outside. But it doesn't matter. We've
            found all of their names.
So, Dumbledore, you've been behind this whole thing.

            
 Dumbledore's Army. Dumbledore smiles pleasantly and spreads
            his hands widely. 
Well, Minister. You've caught me. 
This has all been your doing! You've been recruiting students for your
            army! 
Quite correct, Cornelius. 
I knew it! I KNEW it! You've been plotting against me all this time! 

            
 That's right. 
This is too good to be true! Harry turns to Dumbledore in horror. 
Professor, no! 
Quiet, Harry! 
Yes, shut up, Potter. So, you'll be coming with us to the Ministry-- 
Ah, yes. I was wondering when we'd hit that little snag. 
I see no snag, Dumbledore. 
But I do. You seem to be laboring under the delusion that I would
            'come quietly.' 
Resisting arrest, now are you, Dumbledore? 
Precisely. You see, I have absolutely no intention of going to
               Azkaban.
Don't be silly, Hawkes. Leave the wand there.
You would really take on two Aurors, Dolores, and myself, Dumbledore? 
Naturally. All of you did rather well on your spellwork at this
            school, but if you attempt to take me in by force, I'm afraid I shall have to hurt
               you.
Are you all right? McGonagall is standing, dusting herself off. 
Yes, we're fine. 
 Oh, where will you go, Albus? 
I'm not going into hiding. Fudge will soon regret removing me from
            Hogwarts. Harry moves to Dumbledore's side. 
I'm so sorry, Professor!
It's fine. Now listen to me, Harry. Keep studying Occlumency! Do
            everything Professor Snape tells you. He grips Harry's shoulder. 
Close your mind! You will understand, in time. Fudge is stirring. 
Lay back down. They must not think we have had time to talk. They do
            so. He moves to Fawkes.
Find him!
"By Order of the Ministry of Magic: Dolores Jane Umbridge will replace
            Albus Dumbledore as Head of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry." She looks over
            them all smugly. 
My first act as your new Headmistress is to form an Inquisitional
            Squad, lead by Draco Malfoy. They will report directly to me about the goings on in the
            halls of this school. Harry glares at her. 
Furthermore, our good caretaker, Mr. Filch has requested we reinstate
            the 'old punishments.' I have decided that there is no reason we shouldn't.
Are you sure you can't? Hagrid said it was important. 
No way. Quidditch practice. If I don't show up, Angelina'll go mad. They
            part ways. 
Hagrid...we've been walking for a good hour. 
Its jus' up ahead, here. 
Could you tell us what it is, Hagrid, please? 
All righ'. Well, I'm showin' yeh this, because tha' Umbridge woman put me
            on probation. I can' last much longer afore I get sacked like Trelawney. 
We won't let her! 
Bah. S'not the end o' the world. If I do, I'll go help Dumbledore. Grea'
            man... 
 Anyway, I woudn' tell yeh 'cept for tha'. I can' leave
            withou' makin' arraingmen's, see? 
 I'll need all o' yer help. 
Of course we'll help.
Knew yeh'd say yes! He pauses and glances at them. 
Okay, real quiet like from here on. They creep down the path until Hagrid
            straightens and smiles. 
There we are!
Hagrid, I thought none of them wanted to come! Hagrid looks
            uncomfortable. 
None o' them did, Hermione! I didn' have much ruddy choice inna matter! I
            couldn' leave 'im! 
Oh, why, Hagrid? Why? 
He's me brother! There is a silence in the forest. 
Well, half-brother anyway. Me mum had 'im afore she died.
               
 I though' I could bring 'im back here an' train 'im up a bit.
            Teach 'im a bit o' manners.
Here. I'll introduce yeh to Grawp!
Yeh all righ', Grawp? Grawp gives a low roar. 
Look wha' I brough' yeh, Grawpy! Two new friends an' all. We 'ave Harry
            Potter here, see? An' over here is Hermy.
Hermy!
Bad Grawpy! Bad boy! Grawp roars in pain. 
We don' attack our friends, Grawpy!
See, he don' know any better. Harry glares at him. 
Anyway, all yeh need teh do is go an' talk to 'im. Give 'im a bit o'
               company.
Oh blimey... 
I thought we told you that you were no longer welcome in this place,
            Hagrid. You or that beast you brought from afar. 
S'not up to you who comes and goes in this forest. 
You stopped us from invoking our punishments on Firenze for becoming the
            servant of the humans at Hogwarts. 
Stopped yeh from committin' murder, yeh mean! 
Our ways are not yours, Hagrid. And now you bring that monster here...our
            patience with it wanes swiftly. 
Well, you'll tolerate 'im as long as he's here! The Centaurs paw the
            ground in agitation. 
We allow you to pass this time, Hagrid, because you have young with you.
            But the next time you enter this forest, your life is forfeit. The centaurs vanish into
            the undergrowth again. 
Please sit, Potter.
You're here to have a talk with me about your career thoughts,
            Potter. We do this so we can begin to aim your courses over the next two years to
            prepare you for that career. 
Oh, yeah. Well, I did think about being an Auror. 
Auror. Interesting, Potter. You'll need top grades for that.
            Challenging career path, but not unrewarding. 
Hem hem. 
Now then, Potter, you'll need to concentrate on Defense Against the
            Dark Arts, Potions, Transfiguration, and Charms to adequately prepare yourself for the
            general Auror requirements. 
Hem hem. 
May I offer you a cough drop, Professor Umbridge? 
Oh, no thank you, Minerva. Actually, I was just wondering if Potter has
            the proper temperament to be an Auror. 
Were you indeed. She turns back to Harry. 
If you're serious in this ambition, Potter, I would recommend
            concentrating on bringing your Potions and Charms grades up before your O.W.L.s. I
            daresay you've got enough time if you apply yourself. Lord knows you've consistently
            done well in Defense Against the Dark Arts. Professor Lupin-- 
Excuse me, Minerva, but have you seen my note on Potter's current
            grades in my class? 
Yes, indeed I have. 
Then I think you will find that Potter's grades have been consistently
            poor this year. 
You apparently misunderstand me. I meant that Potter has done well in
            every Defense Against the Dark Arts class taught by a competent teacher.
Now, assuming you've passed all of your necessary classes, the
            Ministry will put you through a number of character and aptitude tests. 
What's involved in them? 
How you stand up under pressure, your perseverance, and dedication,
            things of this nature. Umbridge stands abruptly. 
Harry Potter has no chance of ever becoming an Auror! McGonagall stands
            as well, her eyes locked with Harry's. 
I will assist you in becoming an Auror if it the very last thing I
            do, Potter! I will coach you nightly in order to get the necessary grades! Umbridege
            storms from the room. 
This concludes our meeting, Potter. She smiles at him. He smiles
            back. 
Thanks, Professor. 
You're welcome, Potter. Now hurry or you'll be late for Occlumency.
         
Have you been practicing, Potter?
 
 Well, we shall see, won't we?
Excuse me, Professor. Professor Umbridge says she needs you right away. 
What on earth for? 
Well, sir, remember when Montegue vanished over Christmas? She says he's
            turned up in a toilet on the fourth floor. 
Any idea how he got there? 
He's pretty confused, but I think he said something about the Vanishing
            Closet. Snape stands irritably. 
We will pick your remedial potions lesson up tomorrow, Potter. Draco
            sniggers. They depart.
Put that away, James. James shrugs and does so. 
I'm bored. Wish it was full moon. Lupin snorts. 
Easy for you to say. James nudges Sirius. 
This should cheer you up, Sirius. Look. Sirius grins. 
Excellent! Snivellus! Snape is walking by. The four of them stand and
            follow him. 
All right, there, Snivellus? Snape turns in a flash, wand out. Sirius is
            faster, however. 
Expelliarmus! Snape's wand flies from his hand. He dives for it. 
Impedimenta! Snape stops moving, struggling against INVISIBLE ROPES. 
You just wait... Sirius laughs. 
Wait for what, Snivellus? You to wipe that great greasy nose on
               us?
And now, the moment you've all been waiting for-- 
Leave him alone, James Potter!
Another charity case, Lily? 
What has he done to you? 
Nothing. It's more the fact that he exists, you see...
 
 Levicorpus!
Leave him alone, Potter! James turns and smiles at her. 
I will if you go out with me. 
I wouldn't go out with you if it were a choice between you and the
            giant squid! Now let him down.
Locomotor mortis! Lily draws her wand. 
I said, leave him alone!
Don't make me hex you, Lily. 
Then let him go! 
Fine!
You're lucky Lily was here, Snivellus! 
I don't need help from a mud-blood like her!
Apologize to her! Now! 
Don't make him apologize. Honestly, you're as bad as he is! James
            whirls on her. 
I would never call you that. She shakes her head. 
You make me sick, Potter. She turns and walks away. 
Lily! Hey Lily!
Having fun, Potter?
Been enjoying yourself? 
No! 
Amusing man, your father...
I--sorry!
You will repeat what you saw to no one! Harry is already shaking his head. 
No, of course not!
You had better not, Potter, or you will experience a pain so horrible you
            will wish you had never been born! He pushes Harry away from him. 
Now get out of my sight! Do not set foot in this office ever again! Harry
            turns and runs. 
Today begins your O.W.L exams. A number of Ministry instructors are
            here to give them. Exams will take place for the next two weeks. Exams will be split in
            two parts, theory and practical application. 
 I must warn you that
            the most stringent anti-cheating spells have been added to your exam papers. No student
            has successfully cheated on an O.W.L. in a century, though every year someone tries it.
               
 Naturally, cheating will not be suffered and anyone caught will
            be expelled from Hogwarts. 
Oy! That's Umbridge down there!
They're heading for Hagrid's! Ron and Harry exchange nervous glances. 
Eyes back on the sky, please. The students ignore the
               Professor.
Twenty minutes left on your exam, students.
No! 
Be reasonable, Hagrid! Hagrid yells uncomprehensibly. 
Look! Harry smiles. 
McGonagall'll sort this out! 
 How dare you! How DARE you! She
            breaks into a run. 
Stop this immediately!
Enough!
Not even a warning!
COWARDS!
Get him, get him!
Get her to the hospital wing right away.
Before we begin, I have an update on Professor McGonagall.
            She will be all right, and is resting in the hospital wing. Harry and Ron look
            encouraged. 
You may now turn your papers over and begin.
Can you reach it? Can you take it for me, Black?
I would rather die!
Oh, you will die. Eventually. But there are hours, even days of pain
            awaiting you before then. He releases Sirius, who slumps to the floor, panting for air. 
I'm going to enjoy this, Black. I have you, and soon I shall have the
            weapon. And then not even your pathetic Order can stand in my way! Voldemort laughs, a
            horrible spine-chilling laugh. The room dissolves around Harry. 
Are you all right, Potter? Harry shakes his head. 
Pressure of exams. It happens. Take a breath, and maybe
            you'll be ready to go back in. Time is nearly up, but-- Harry is shaking his head. 
No--no, I've done all I can.
You all right? 
Voldemort! He's got Sirius! In the Department of Mysteries! Ron looks
            pale. 
How do you know? 
I just saw it.
How're we going to get there? 
To the Department of Mysteries? 
We've got to do something! Ron and Hermione exchange looks. 
How'd Voldemort get into the Ministry of Magic without being seen? I
            mean, he and Sirius are the two most wanted wizards in the world... 
Yeah. They can't just waltz into the Ministry of Magic! 
It just seems so unlikely, Harry! Harry grabs her robes and glares at
            her. 
I won't let Sirius die! Just then Ginny, Luna, Fred, and George round the
            corner. 
We heard Harry yelling. What's up? 
Voldemort's broken into the Department of Mysteries. He's got Sirius
            there! 
 He could already have the weapon! 
Think, Harry! Voldemort knows you! He knows you'd rush off to save
            Sirius. 
There isn't anyone else, Hermione! Everyone from the Order is gone! 
Anything we can do to help? 
No, there isn't!
Yes, they can, Harry. 
How? 
Before we do anything, we need to establish that Sirius really isn't at
            Headquarters. Which means we'll need to break into Umbridge's office. She smiles, and
            glances at Fred and George. 
For that, we'll need a really good distraction. Fred and George grin. 
Right you are, Hermione. Think we can whip something up, George? 
Might be able to. 
Just give us a few seconds. 
Mind you, it's got to be really good! 
Not to worry, Hermione. We've got something that will outdue everything
            else we've done here combined. 
It's been too quiet around here anyway. 
Time we did some real damage to this place.
We'll also need to keep everyone away from her office. Ginny brightens. 
We can do that! Me and Luna'll guard the hallway. Harry smiles at them. 
We'll probably only manage five minutes or so. 
That's all we'll need. Fred and George straighten. 
Right. You've got ten minutes to get to Umbridge's office. And whatever you
            do, stay away from the Astronomy Tower for the next couple of hours. 
Unless they spread, in which case, I'd get out of the castle for a while.
            They leave. Hermione turns to Harry. 
Break out your Invisibility Cloak, Harry. 
Professor! It's those Weasley twins! They've set something off in the
            Astronomy Tower! Umbridge smiles twistedly. 
Ready to try out the old punishments again? 
 They've had this coming for a long time!
Grimmauld Place!
Sirius! Are you here! 
That was worth it! Filch steps back around the corner, grinning evilly. 
I've got you now!
Thank you for playing, one and all. 
And now, we've got to go! They turn and vanish down another hallway.
         
Sirius! Lupin? Hello? 
What's this? The Potter boy in the fire... Kreacher comes into view of
            the fireplace. 
Kreacher, where's Sirius? 
Master went out. 
So, turning a hallway into a swamp is funny, is it? 
Fairly amusing, yeah. 
Well, now you're going to learn what happens to wrongdoers in my
            school. Filch pulls out a long evil-looking BLACK WHIP, smiling. 
This was never your school! Hogwarts is Dumbledore's school! There is a
            loud cheer from the students filling the hall. Umbridge looks around, livid with rage. 
Well, now you're going to get your punishments right here, in front of
            the whole school! Fred snorts. 
You know, I don't think we are. 
George, I think we've outgrown full- time education. Wouldn't you agree? 
Completely, Fred. 
Time to enter the real world? 
Definitely. Together they raise their wands. 
Accio brooms! 
We won't be seeing you. 
Yeah, don't bother writing.
Be sure to visit us at our new premises on Diagon Alley!
You know where he is, don't you? 
Master does not tell Kreacher where he goes. 
But you know. Kreacher grins horribly. 
Master will never return from the Department of Mysteries!

            
 Harry!
You think you could simply walk into my office without me knowing about
            it? Foolish boy!
Accio wand! Harry's wand flips from his pocket to Umbridge's hand. 
Who were you trying to contact? 
It's none of your business. 
Draco, would you fetch Professor Snape, please? Draco leaves. Umbridge
            smiles sickeningly at Harry. 
Very well, Potter. I have been patient enough with you. Draco returns
            with Snape. 
You wished to see me? 
I have just caught Potter trying to communicate with someone in my
            fire. I need some Veritaserum. Truth syrum. 
Well, it appears that I cannot help you. I have none. He turns to leave.
            Harry looks at him desperately. 
He's got Padfoot at the place it's hidden! 
What? What does that mean? 
Potter, if I want nonsense shouted at me, I shall inform you. He sweeps
            from the office. Umbridge is enraged. 
We've played nicely, Potter. You leave me no choice! She draws her
            wand, moving menacingly at Harry. 
You could have saved me a lot of trouble if those Dementors I sent to
            your house had finished you off! 
You sent the Dementors? 
Of course I did! Someone had to act! She points her wand at Harry's
            chest. 
CRUCIO!
No! Please, stop! Umbridge looks pleased and turns to Hermione. 
Well, well. 
Hermione, no! 
We have to tell her, Harry... 
I would rather die! 
Shut up, Potter! Now talk, you silly girl! Who were you talking to? 
We were trying to find Professor Dumbledore. We had to tell him... 
Tell him? 
That it's ready. The weapon.
You and Mr. Potter will take me to it. 
Much further, is it? 
Oh, yes. It's very well hidden.
What are you doing in our forest? 
Your forest? This forest belongs to the Ministry of Magic! The centaurs
            move closer. 
Stay back, you beasts!
You cannot attack me! Any attack on a wizard by a half-breed-- 
Don't call them that! Magorian ROARS in anger. 
You dare to insult us?
Come no closer! Magorian rears up on his hind-legs and beats his chest. 
Incarcerus!
Ingrates! Animals! Filthy half- bloods! There is BLAST like a GUNSHOT
            and Umbridge screams again. Harry and Hermione are grabbed by two Centaurs. 
What of these two? 
God, I can't wait until all you Weasleys have been expelled. Your stench
            has been fouling this castle for too long. Ron glares at him. 
Shut up, Malfoy!
That's for speaking to me. You know, you Weasleys are just as bad as
               Mudbloods!
You know, Weasley, it's really too bad Potter saved you from the Chamber
            of Secrets. Ginny struggles against Crabbe, who is restraining her. Ron snatches up his
            wand. 
Stupify!
Expelliarmus! 
Haggar! There is another silence. Grawp sees Harry and Hermione. 
Hermy! Where Haggar? The centaurs raise their bows to point at the giant. 
Grawp, help us! Grawp ROARS again and BEATS his CHEST. 
Grawp save Hermy!

            

         
Great plan, Hermione. 
I thought it worked out rather nicely. 
What are we supposed to do now? 
That's just what we were wondering.
So, how do we get to the Ministry?
I'd imagine we should fly. 
We've got no brooms. 
There are other ways to fly. She nods in the direction of the forest. 
I mean, they can fly, and they're very good at finding places you need to
            go. Harry turns around and sees three THESTRALS watching them. 
What are those? 
What are what? He looks right at them and doesn't see them. 
There's nothing there, Harry. 
Yes, there is. They're Thestrals. You can't see them unless you've seen
            someone die. Neville is quiet. Finally, he looks up. 
I can see them too. Harry claps his hands. 
All right, then. Get on one, and we'll be off. 
And what about those of us who can't see them? Luna comes over to them. 
I'll show you. 
Never again... 
What now, Harry?
All right, come on.
Department of Mysteries.
Where is everyone? 
The Ministry closed a half-hour ago. I expect they all went home. Harry
            nods grimly. 
That's how Voldemort got in unnoticed. They walk until they reach the
            hallway from Harry's dreams. 
This is it. Come on.
Stay close. He steps into the next room. 
Now where?
I don't understand. In my dream, the doors weren't identical. 
Well, let's try a few. Harry nods. 
Yeah. I'll know the way when I see it. He goes to the first door he sees
            and opens the door. He steps inside. The others follow. 
Who's there?
Sirius? 
There's no one here, Harry. This isn't the right room. 
Does anyone else hear that? 
I do. It's coming from the Veil.

            
 Harry... His eyes are locked on the veil. He walks closer. 
There are people in there! 
What do you mean, people? 
Harry, I think we should leave. Harry reaches out his hand towards the
               veil.
Harry, we're here for Sirius, remember? Harry stops. He blinks and
            drops his hand. 
Sirius...yeah...
 
 Whatever's in there, the Ministry sure doesn't want anyone getting to it.
            He moves to the next door and opens it, stepping inside. 
This is it! Come on! They move through the clocks.
This is it. This is where Sirius is! He opens the door and charges
            through. 
He's in here somewhere.
I don't think Sirius is here. Ron stares at one of the orbs. 
Harry, have you seen this? Harry looks over his shoulder. 
Er...it's got your name on it. Sure enough, there was a golden orb resting
            on the shelf with the label "S.P.T. to A.P.W.B.D.: The Dark Lord and 

            Harry Potter."
What's my name doing here? 
Don't touch it, Harry! Harry glares at her.
 
 Yeah, Harry, don't. He looks at Neville, who is very pale. 
It's got my name on it! He takes it off the shelf and looks at it. 
I warned you before that one day you would come to a sticky end, Potter. 
Where's Sirius? Lucius, and several other death eaters laugh. 
We don't have him, if that's what you mean. Harry is stunned. 
You never did, did you? It was all just a trick. 
The Dark Lord knows your weakness for heroics, Potter. All it took was a
            little nudge to get you here.
Now give me that prophesy. 
What prophesy? Lucius points at the Golden orb. 
That prophesy. Now hand it over or we'll have to use wands on you.
Go ahead. Lucius regards him coldly. 
Very brave of you, Potter. Or are you foolish? 
Come and find out! Lucius doesn't move. 
Really, Potter. You expect to defeat all of us with your little school
            friends? Now hand it over, and they won't have to die here.
I haven't escaped from Azkaban for this! She raises her wand. Lucius
            forces her arm down. 
No! If the prophesy is smashed--
Take the youngest girl. We'll see how committed Potter is as we
            torture her.
You even try to take her and I'll smash this thing.
So, what kind of prophesy are we talking about here? 
Surely you jest, Potter? 
Not really. How come Voldemort wants it? 
You dare to speak the Dark Lord's name? 
Who, Voldemort? Oh, yeah, I dare. Voldemort, voldemort, Voldemort-- 
Silence! How dare you utter that name from your half-blood mouth! 
Hey, did you know Voldemort's a half-blood too? Bella raises her wand to
            strike, but Malfoy stops her again. 
Control yourself, Bellatrix! 
What's so special about this prophesy anyway? Bella shrieks with laughter. 
You mean Dumbledore never told you the reason you bear that scar was
            hidden here? Harry looks as if slapped, he is so surprised. 
What? Lucius and the Death Eaters laugh. 
 When I give the signal, blast the shelves...
            Hermione and Ron nod grimly. 
So that's what took you so long. We wondered. 
But why did he need me to take it? 
Only a person for whom the prophesy was made can remove it from its self,
            Potter, and the Dark Lord certainly couldn't get it himself. Harry is angry. 
So he used me to do his dirty work, did he? 
Precisely, Potter. 
NOW!
RUN!
Stupify!
Stop them! Harry is the last through the door. 
Colloportus! The door seals itself.
Where'd the rest go? Hermione looks around. 
Harry, they went the wrong way!
They might have gone on to the hall. 
Check under the desks. Harry leaps out from under his desk. 
Stupify!
Avada-- Neville emerges from beneath his desk. 
Expelliarmus! Bella's wand flies from her fingers. Harry finishes her
            off. 
Stupify!
Ron! Two Death Eaters enter the room. 
Impedimenta!
We've got him! 
Silenco! Stupify! The death eater falls silent, and then to the ground.
            Harry staggers to his feet, dazed. 
Pretificus Totalus!
Stupify! The death eater falls over. 
Hermione! He runs to her. She appears to be sleeping. 
Please don't be dead, please don't be dead... He shakes her. 
Hermione, wake up... Neville runs over. 
What's they do to her? Harry shakes his head. Neville feels her wrist. 
She's alive, Harry. There's a pulse. Harry sighs in relief. 
Can we carry her? 
I'll do it. You're better at fighting.
Where do we go? 
I don't know...
What happened. 
I think my ankle's broken. And somebody hit Ron with a weird spell... Ron
            laughs strangely. 
Hiyya, Harry. 
 You look funny.... He laughs
               again.
They hit her with something too. Harry straightens. 
We need to get out of here. Luna, can you help Ginny? Luna moves to her
            side. Another door opens, and five death eaters emerge. 
There they are!
Your race is run, Potter. Hand it over. Harry glances around frantically. 
Let my friends go and I will.
You are not in a position to negotiate. Neville struggles against the
            Death Eater holding him. 
Don't do it, Harry! Don't! 
Stop, Neville!
Neville? Neville Longbottom? She laughs in glee. 
My dear boy, I paid your parents a visit a long time ago. We had such
            a time! 
You put them in St. Mungos! Bellatrix beams at him. 
So, Potter. Give us the Prophesy or I'll see how long it takes to
            crack Longbottom like his parents. Harry is desperate. 
Don't give it to them! Bellatrix points her wand at him. 
Crucio!
Are you all right? 
Yeah...
Give me the prophesy!
Get out of here, you two! He points at one of the doors. 
That will take you back out of the Department of Mysteries. Sirius makes
            to go back to the fight. Harry grabs his hand. 
You come with us! Sirius shakes his head. 
You're the important one, now, Harry. I have to help the Order.
I'll always be here for you, Harry. Now go!
Hello, cousin!
Potter!
We may have lost the prophesy, but I can still deliver you to the Dark
            Lord! He waves his wand. 
Stupify!
Protego! Malfoy's spell bounces away from Harry.
It's Dumbledore!
Is that the best you've got, cousin?

            
 Sirius!

            
 Let me go! He hits at Lupin, trying to break away from him. 
Harry! HARRY!...he's gone...there's nothing you can do... Harry hits him
            across the face, still struggling wildly. 
LIAR!
No...no...no....
Harry, no!
You can't stop me, Potter!
Stupify!
Come out, come out, Potter... Harry grows more angry by the second. 
Well, well, have you come to avenge your dear Godfather? Harry leaps
            out from behind the fountain. 
Crucio!
Crucio!
Never used an Unforgivable Curse before, have you, Potter? You have to
            mean it, you have to want to cause the pain in your very soul...
Give me the prophesy! 
Can't. It got smashed by accident! 
You lie! Harry laughs. 
How's Voldemort going to like that? You've failed him, and he's not very
            forgiving, is he? Bellatrix lets out a shriek of horror. 
Forgive me, Master! I tried, I-- Harry laughs again. 
He can't hear you from here, you know! 
Can't I, Potter?
So, you smashed my prophesy...
I grow tired of you continually thwarting my plans, Harry Potter! He
            snaps his wand down. 
Avada Kadavra!
You should not have come here tonight, Tom. 
It is you who made that mistake, Dumbledore!
Avada Kedavra!
You do not seek to kill me, Dumbledore? 
There are other ways to destroy a man, Tom. 
There is nothing worse than death! 
You are quite wrong, Tom, as you have always been.
Look out!
Professor! He stands up. 
Stay where you are, Harry! Dumbledore sounds frightened.
 Kill me now, Dumbledore...do it, if death means
               nothing...
Harry!
Are you all right, Harry? Harry nods, dazed. 
Minister, I saw him! You-Know-Who! He was right there!
I know...I saw him too...
If you and your men will proceed to the Death Room, you will find
            several Death Eaters which I and some others have apprehended. Fudge points at
            Dumbledore. 
Seize him!
Minister, you have just seen You- Know-Who in the flesh only seconds
            ago! It is time to come to your senses! Fudge looks cowed. 
If you insist on trying to arrest me, I am perfectly willing
            demonstrate how useless such an attempt will be.
Dumbledore, what the blazes happened here?
I will explain everything, Minister. Just as soon as I return Harry
            to school. Fudge 
 turns to see Harry for the first
            time. 
What's he doing here? And what's happened to him?
Minister, you will order the removal of Dolores Umbridge from my
            school. 
 Also, she will probably need medical attention, having had
            a violent encounter with some Centaurs earlier this evening. 

            

         
 All Educational Decrees will be nullified and
            you will call off the search on Hagrid so he can return to work. Fudge is sputtering
            incomprehensibly. 
I will return here later tonight, after I have seen to Harry. It
            should not take long. He taps the Golden centaur head. 
Portus. He motions Harry over. 
Dumbledore, I want some answers! 
The Second War has begun, Minister.
Thank you...
Please sit, Harry.
I understand how you feel, Harry-- 
No you don't!
You forget that Sirius was my friend too. You are not the only person
            on this earth capable of feelings, Harry. Harry nearly snarls at him. 
There is no shame in feeling pain, Harry. It is your greatest
            strength... 
You don't have a clue! You can't possibly know! 
What can't I know?
This pain is part of being human, Harry... 
 Then I don't want to be human!
I don't care! I don't care!
You do care. You care so much you feel like you will bleed to death
            because of it. Harry gets to his feet.
Let me out. 
No. Harry draws his wand, looking furious. 
You can't keep me in here! 
I daresay I can. And if you actually do attack me with that wand,
            Harry, I'm afraid to say you will regret it.
It is my fault Sirius died tonight. 
 I have kept
            things from you, Harry. Things that I should not have concealed. You had a right to
            know, but I put off telling you. Dumbledore sighs, sadly, and suddenly he seems very
            old. 
Had I told you that Voldemort might try to lure you down to the
            Department of Mysteries you would never have gone there tonight. Sirius would never have
            gone after you. 
 That fault lies with me. I hope that you can find
            it in your heart to forgive me one day. Harry stares angrily out the window. 
Harry, I owe you this explanation, to show you the failings of an old
            man. Harry continues staring out the window. 
Our explanation begins with your scar. You already know that it is a
            connection between you and Voldemort, and that this connection goes both ways.
               
 I grew worried that Voldemort would at some point discover this
            connection, which he did the night Mr. Weasely was attacked. 
I already know all this. 
Haven't you wondered why I haven't spoken to you, even looked at you,
            for months? 
Well, yeah, I did... 
I was worried that if Voldemort discovered there was a closer
            relationship between us than simply between teacher and student he would use you to spy
            on the Order. Another mistake. 
 Voldemort showed us both tonight
            that his aim in possessing you would not be to destroy me, but to destroy you. Harry
            looks at his shoes. 
Sirius told me you believed there was a snake inside of you. This was
            Voldemort attempting to manipulate you. To protect you from this, I had you study
            Occlumency. 
But Snape stopped giving me lessons. 
Yes. I thought he could overcome his feelings towards your father,
            but I was wrong. Some wounds cut too deep to be healed. 
He barely taught me, though. I always felt more open to it after the
            lessons. Like he was trying to open me to Voldemort-- 
I would trust Severus Snape with my life, Harry. You have never
            recovered from your mistrust of him in your first year. 
Sirius didn't trust him. Didn't believe he'd really turned to our side... 
Again, some wounds run too deep to be healed, Harry. Severus and
            Sirius never liked each other at school. This has never changed. Harry glares at the
            carpet. 
During your Occulumency lessons, Professor Snape discovered that you
            were dreaming about the door in the Department of Mysteries. 
I've been dreaming about that all year, before Voldemort discovered the
            connection. 
Yes. Voldemort has been obsessed with hearing that prophesy since he
            returned. Because of your scar, what he was obsessed with, you were obsessed with, in
            the form of dreams. 

            

         
 Once he discovered the connection, Voldemort had
            little difficulty in manipulating you into thinking he had captured Sirius. 
But I checked Grimmauld Place! Kreacher said-- 
Kreacher lied. He wanted you to go to the Department of Mysteries. 
Why? 
Kreacher has been serving two masters for some months now. 
What? 
It appears that when Sirius told him to get out, Kreacher thought he
            meant out of the house. So he went to the Black's closest relatives, the Malfoys.
               
 Obviously, they questioned him. Sirius had forbidden him from
            giving up important secrets. But Sirius had neglected to mention his relationship with
            you. 
 He told them how you saw him as a mixture of father and
            brother, and that you would move heaven and earth to save Sirius. 

            Voldemort knew that making you believe he had Sirius in the Department of Mysteries
            would force you there. 
Wait, where was Sirius when I tried to contact him? 
Ah. Apparently Kreacher had injured Buckbeak to distract him in case
            you tried to contact Headquarters. 

         
 Sirius was tending to the wounds when you
            called. 
And Hermione said we should be nice to Kreacher! 
She was quite right, Harry. Kreacher is what wizards have made him.
            He is to be pitied, not hated. 
Sirius hated him. 
He didn't hate Kreacher himself. Kreacher was a reminder to Sirius of
            the home he had always hated. 
Yeah, he really hated that place. And you kept him locked up in there! 
I was trying to save his life!
It is time to tell you what I should have five years ago. No doubt
            you have wondered why it was that I sent you there and not to a wizarding family?
               
 I did it for your protection. You were in more danger than
            anyone realized. Voldemort was defeated, but his servants were everywhere. Harry is
            silent. 
I also knew that Voldemort would return one day. I played to his
            weakness. There is an ancient magic which Voldemort has always underestimated.
               

            

         
 This magic is what your mother gave you when she
            died. That protection would only work, however, if you were cared for by a blood
            relative. Your Aunt, Petunia. 
She never loved me. 
Perhaps not. But she took you in, however grudgingly. As long as you
            can call your Aunt's house your home, you are protected. Harry looks away. 
And now we come to the moment of terrible truth, the moment I have
            dreaded for fifteen years. The moment when I must lay another burden atop your already
            straining shoulders. Harry stares into his blue eyes. 
Do you remember your first year here? When you lay in the hospital
            wing fresh from your confrontation with Voldemort? Harry nods. 
Do you remember what you asked me that night? 
I asked you why Voldemort tried to kill me. 
Yes. I decided not to tell you then. After all, eleven was too young
            for such burdens. The same went for twelve. But I was running out of excuses by thirteen
            and fourteen. Do you see the flaw in my plan yet? Harry shakes his head. 
I cared about you too much. I became more concerned with your
            happiness and well-being than with the truth and the lives it could save. That was my
            greatest mistake. It was exactly what Voldemort expects from us fools who love.
               
 But I could not bear to tell you. I have watched you pass
            through greater trials than any other student in the history of this school, and I could
            not bear to add another one, the greatest one of all. He looks at Harry, sympathy and
            regret etched on his face. 
You have no idea the pain it causes me to tell it to you, even now.
            But unfortunately, I must. 
I don't understand, Professor. Dumbledore sighs again. 
The reason Voldemort tried to kill you is because of a prophesy made
            just before your birth. By attempting to kill you, he believed he was fulfilling the
            terms of the prophesy. Voldemort's mistake was that he had not heard the entire
            prophesy. 
 That is the weapon we have been guarding, and which he
            has been so desperately seeking: the knowledge of how to destroy you. Harry sighs this
            time. He looks at the floor. 
Professor, why am I so important to him? Harry hangs his head. 
An excellent question, Harry. The answer lies in the prophesy. 
Sir, it got smashed. 
That was not the only place the Prophesy is preserved.
"The One with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches....Born
            to those who have thrise defied him, born as the Seventh Month dies...and the Dark Lord
            will mark him as his equal, but he will have a power the Dark Lord knows not...and
            either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other
            survives....The One with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord will be born as the Seventh
            Month dies..." The image of Trelawney fades. Harry looks staggered. 
I'm not sure I understand all that, sir... 
It means that the only person with a chance of defeating Voldemort
            was born at the end of July to parents who had resisted him three times before. 
And...it means me? 
Interestingly, there were two boys whom the prophesy could have been
            referring to. You and Neville Longbottom. 
So it's not necessarily me, sir? 
You forget the next qualification of the prophesy. The Dark Lord will
            mark this boy as his equal. 
 In giving you that scar, Voldemort did
            so. I'm afraid that the prophesy is most certainly referring to you. 
What if he chose wrong? 
He chose the child he believed to be the more dangerous. He chose the
            "half-blood" wizard because he saw some of himself in you. 
 He tried
            to kill you and instead gave you the power and the future to destroy him. 
Why didn't he wait? Why attack when we were babies? 
Voldemort had an informant listening to my meeting with Professor
            Trelawney. Fortunately he was discovered before he could hear the entire prophesy.
            Voldemort had to act immediately, he didn't know the rest of the prophesy. All he knew
            was that he had to destroy the child who would grow to be a threat to his power. 
But I don't have any special powers. Dumbledore is silent for a moment. 
There is a room in the Department of Mysteries which is kept locked
            at all times. It contains a force so wonderful and yet terrible that it is greater than
            death itself. It is that power which you have incredible amounts of and of which
            Voldemort has none. 
What is it, sir? 
This power drove you to save Sirius tonight. It kept Voldemort from
            possessing you, he cannot bear to touch it. 
 In the end, it was your
            heart and not your head that saved you. Harry looks away. 
There is only the end of the prophesy which we haven't addressed. It
            states "neither can live while the other survives." Harry slowly looks up at Dumbledore. 
It is the final burden which I must place on you, Harry. 
One of us has to kill the other...in the end. Dumbledore nods, and there
            are tears misting his eyes. 
Yes.
 Hello, Harry.
Hey, Nick.
 I--Well, Madam Pomfrey asked me to tell you that Hermione and
            Ron are out of the hospital wing. 
Oh. Thanks. He stands and they begin to walk back to the castle together. 
Nick, I was wondering about something? Nick looks even more uncomfortable
            now. 
 I've been expecting this... 
Expecting what? 
 A lot of people come to me when they've lost loved ones. 
I expect so... There is a silence. 
 He's not coming back, Harry. There is another silence. 
 Few wizards choose the path I have chosen. 
Why? 
 I am neither here nor there, Harry. Trapped between two
            worlds. That does not appeal to most. 
 I know nothing of the secrets
            of death, Harry. I was afraid of it. I preferred to survive as a feeble imitation of
            life than face the vast unknown. 
 I often wonder if that was a wise
            decision. They approach the great doors leading to the entry hall. Nick looks at Harry. 
 I'm sorry I couldn't be of more help, Harry. Truly I
               am.
Harry!
How are you? 
Good as new, mate.
 How are you doing, Harry? Harry pauses for a
            long moment, thinking.
 
 Come on, let's go in to the feast. Harry shakes his head. 
You two go on. I want to be alone for a while.
I've got something to tell you. Something important. They stop and look at
            him again. 
But not right now. I'm not ready. 
Take your time, Harry. We'll be here when you are.
Hello, Harry. He walks up to her. 
It's the last night and I need to pack. 
Then why are you putting up signs? 
Oh, people take my things and hide them. 

         
 I don't think they like me much. Some of them call me
            "Loony" Lovegood. Harry looks at her in pity. 
Do you need any help looking? 
Oh no. It all turns up in the end. She looks at him serenely. 
Sirius Black. Hermione said he was your Godfather. 
Yeah. 
 Have you ever...you know... 
My mother. I was nine. 
I'm sorry. 
It's okay. It's not like I'll never see her again. 
Isn't it? 
Don't tell me you didn't hear them. The voices beyond the Veil? Harry looks
            startled. 
They were just out of sight, that's all. 
You mean we'll see them again? 
Of course. 
 Things always work out, in the end.
 Lumos Maxima... 
 Lumos Maxima... 
 Lumos Maxima... 
 Lumos... MAXIMA! 
 Harry! Harry bounds down the stairs and into the
    front hall, where his AUNT PETUNIA and cousin DUDLEY stand stiffly. Petunia flicks a bit of
    fluff from Dudley's sweater, glowers crossly at Harry, and jerks her head toward the door. Well,
    go on. 
 Open it. Harry reaches for the knob when -- BLAM! -- it BURSTS OPEN,
    revealing a LARGE, WADDLING WOMAN (AUNT MARGE) and a LARGE WADDLING BULLDOG (RIPPER). Uncle
    Vernon lurches forward out of the teeming RAIN, an ENORMOUS SUITCASE in hand, and drops it on
    Harry. 
 Marge! Welcome! How was the train? 
 Wretched. Ripper got sick. 
 Ah. How... unfortunate. 
 I would've left him with the others, but he pines so when I'm away. Don't
    you, darling? Aunt Marge puckers her lips at Ripper and leads him down the hallway. Harry
    follows with Uncle Vernon. 
 Uncle Vernon. I need you to sign this form. 
 What is it? 
 Nothing. Something for school... 
 Later perhaps. If you behave. 
 I will if she does. 

    
 So. Still here, are you? 
 Yes. 
 Don’t say 'yes' in that ungrateful tone. Damn good of my brother to keep
    you, if you ask me. 
 It'd have been straight to an orphanage
    if he'd been dumped on my doorstep. 

   
 Is that my Dudders! Hm? Is that my neffy poo? Come and say hello to your
    Auntie Marge. 
 Can I tempt you, Marge? 
 Just a small one. A bit more... a bit more... That's the boy.
     
 Aah. Excellent nosh, Petunia. It's normally just a fry-up
    for me, what with twelve dogs. 

   
 What are you smirking at! Where is it that you send him, Vernon? 
 St. Brutus's. It's a first-rate institution for hopeless cases.
     

   
 I see. And do they use the cane at St. Brutus's, boy? 

    
 Oh, yes. I've been beaten loads of times. 
 Excellent. I won't have this namby-pamby wishy-washy nonsense about not
    hitting people who deserve it. 
 Still. Mustn't blame yourself for
    how this one's turned out, Vernon. It all comes down to blood. Bad blood will out. What is it
    the boy's father did, Petunia? 

    
 Nothing. That is... he didn't work. He was -- unemployed. 
 Of course. And a drunk, I expect - 
 That's a lie. 

   
 What did you say? 
 My dad wasn't a drunk. 
 Oh my goodness! Marge! 
 Not to worry, Petunia. I have a very firm grip. 
 You go to bed. Now. 
 Quiet, Vernon. It doesn't matter about the father. In the end it comes
    down to the mother. You see it all the time with dogs. If there's something wrong with the
    bitch, there'll be something wrong with the pup... 
 Shut up! Shut up! 
 MARGE! 
 Don't worry! I've got you... 
 Vernon. Don't you dare -
 YOU BRING HER BACK! YOU BRING HER BACK AND PUT HER RIGHT! 
 No! She deserved what she got! And you... you keep away from me. 
 You're not allowed to do magic out of school. They won't have you now.
    You've got nowhere to go. 
 Anywhere's better than here. 
 Aaaah! 

    
 Welcome to the Knight Bus. Emergency transport for the
    stranded witch or wizard. My name is Stan Shunpike, and I will be your conductor this evening.
     
 Wha' choo doin' down there? 
 Fell over. 
 Wha' choo fall over for? 
 I didn't do it on purpose. 
 Well, come on then. Let's not wait for the grass to grow. 
 Not now... I'm pickling slugs... 
 Take 'er away, Ern. 
 Yeah, take it away! 
 Wot you say your name was again? 
 I didn't. 
 Whereabouts you headin'? 
 The Leaky Cauldron. That's in London - 
 Is it now? Get that, Ern? The Leaky Cauldron. That's in London. 
 Leaky Cauldron! Stay away from the pea soup! 
 Isn't this a bit... dangerous? 
 Naah. Haven't had an accident in -- what? -- a week is it, Ern? 
 Heads up! Little old lady at twelve o'clock! 
 Who is that? That man. 
 Who is that? That's Sirius Black, that is. Don' tell me you ne'er been
    hearin' o' Sirius Black? 
 A murderer, he is. Got 'imself locked up in Azkaban for it. 
 How'd he escape? 
 Tha's the question, isn't it? He's the firs' that's done it. Gives me
    the collywobbles thinking he's out there, though, I'll tell you that. Big supporter of YouKnow-'
    Oo, Black was. Reckon you heard o' him. 
 Yeah. Him I've heard of. 
 Hate that. 
 This bus. Don't the Muggles ever... 
 Them! Don' listen properly, do they? Don' look properly either. Never
    notice nuffink, they don'. 
 Turn! Turn! 
 Mr. Potter... at last. 
 
 Right smart bird you've got there, Mr. Potter. Arrived only minutes before
    yourself. A MAN CLEARS his throat. Harry turns, finds a PINSTRIPED SILHOUETTE (CORNELIUS FUDGE)
    at the window, staring at the ghostly shadows beyond. Harry's reflection shivers in the glass,
    but the man doesn't turn. Tom takes a position against the wall, fishes a pair of WALNUTS from
    his pocket and -- CRACK -- crushes the shells between his palms. 
 I should tell you, Mr. Potter, earlier this evening your uncle's
    sister was located just south of Sheffield, circling a chimney stack. The Accidental Magic
    Reversal Department was dispatched and she's been properly punctured and her memory modified.
    She has no recollection of the incident whatsoever. 
 So that's that, and no harm done. 
 Pea soup?
     
 No thank you. Minister... I don't understand. I broke the law. Underage wizards
    aren't allowed to use magic at home - 

    
 Oh, come now, Harry. The Ministry doesn't send people to
    Azkaban for blowing up their aunts! On the other hand... running away like that... given the
    state of things... very, very irresponsible. 
 'The state of things' sir? 
 We have a killer on the loose. 
 Sirius Black, you mean. But... what's that got to do with me? 
 Hm? Oh, nothing. You're safe, that's what matters. Tomorrow you'll be
    on your way to Hogwarts. These are your new schoolbooks. I took the liberty of having them
    brought here for you. 
 By the way, Harry. Whilst you're here it would be best if you
    didn't... wander. 
 Housekeeping. 

    
 I'll come back later. 
 I'm warning you, Hermione! Keep that bloody beast of yours
    away from Scabbers or I'll turn it into a tea cozy. 
 He's a cat, Ronald! What do you expect? It's in his
    nature. As Harry reaches bottom, he finds RON WEASLEY protectively cradling Scabbers, while
    HERMIONE GRANDER does her best to restrain a HISSING Crookshanks. 
 A cat! Is that what they told you? Looks more like a pig with hair if you ask me. 
 That's rich coming from the owner of that smelly old shoe brush.
     
 It's all right, Crookshanks. You just ignore the mean little
    boy... 

   
 Harry. 
 Egypt! What's it like? 
 Brilliant. It's got loads of old stuff. Mummies. Death masks. Tombs - 
 You know, the ancient Egyptians of the Nile River delta worshipped the cat
    goddess Bast. 
 I also got a new wand. 
 Not flashing that clipping about again, are you, Ron? 
 I haven't shown anyone! 
 No, not a soul. Unless you count Tom. The day maid. The night maid. The cook.
    The bloke that came to fix the toilet. That wizard from Belgium... 
 It's good to see you, Harry. 
 Good to see you too, Mrs. Weasley. 
 Harry. I wonder if I might have a word. 
 Of course, Mr. Weasley. 
 George's nose looks positively massive in that photograph. 
 That's your nose, Fred. 
 Bloody hell. 'Tis, isn't it? Take after your side of the family, don't I, Mum?
     
 Harry. There are some within the Ministry who would strongly
    discourage me from divulging what I'm about to tell you. But I think you need to know the facts.
    Because you're in danger. Grave danger. 
 Has this anything to do with him, sir? 
 What do you know of Sirius Black, Harry? 
 That he escaped from Azkaban. That he killed someone... 
 Harry, thirteen years ago, when you stopped... 
 Voldemort...? 

    
 Black lost everything. But he remains a loyal servant to this
    day. In his mind, only you stand in the way of... 
 Voldemort...? 
 Harry, I hate it when you say - 
 I know, sorry. Ron hates it too. 
 In Black's mind, only you stand in the way of... You-Know-Who
    returning to power. That's why he's broken. That's why he's broken out of Azkaban. To find you.
    And... 
 Kill me? 
 Harry. I want you to swear that -- whatever you might hear - you won't
    go looking for Black. 
 Mr. Weasley, why would I go looking for someone who wants to kill me? 
 Just watch yourself, will you, Harry? 
 She hands Scabbers through the open window to him. 
 I didn't mean to blow her up. I just... (troubled by the memory) ... lost
    control. 
 Brilliant! 
 Honestly, Ron, it's not funny. Harry's lucky he wasn't expelled. 
 I still think it was brilliant. SNAP! SNAP! SNAP! A copy of the The Monster Book
    of Monsters SCUTTLES CRAB-LIKE down the aisle, pursued by NEVILLE LONGBOTTOM. Hi, Harry. 
 Ron. Hermione. 
 Hi, Neville. 

   
 C'mon. We're in here. 
 Who d'you reckon he is? 
 Professor R.J. Lupin. 
 You know everything. How is it she knows everything? 
 It's on his case. 
 Is he really asleep? 
 Seems to be. Why? What is it, Harry? 
 Close the door. 
 Let me get this straight. Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban to come after you?
    Yes. 
 
 But they'll catch Black, won't they? I mean... eventually? 
 Sure -- Of course, no one's ever broken out of Azkaban before and he's a raving,
    murderous lunatic... Just then, the COMPARTMENT RATTLES. Lanterns flicker. The train LURCHES,
    begins to SLOW. Hermione slides down the seat, pinning Ron against the window. They exchange an
    awkward glance, then Hermione carefully slides to the other end of the seat and glances at her
    WATCH. Frowns. 
 Why're we stopping? We can't be there yet... Harry rises, slides open the
    door, peers into the corridor. HARRY'S POV -- All along the carriage, HEADS look out curiously.
    Then -- the train JERKS -- the car SWAYS -and the LAMPS running along the ceiling FLICKER and...
   
 What's going on? 
 Dunno... Maybe we've broken down? 
 Ouch! Ron, that was my foot! 
 There's something moving out there. I think... people are coming aboard. 
 Bloody hell. What's happening? 
 Don't. Move. 
 Harry? Harry, are you all right? 
 Thanks. 
 Chocolate. Eat. It'll help. 
 What was that -- that thing? 
 A Dementor. One of the guards of Azkaban. It's gone now. 
 It was searching the train, Harry. For Sirius Black. 
 I need to have a word with the driver. Excuse me. 
 Eat. It'll help. 
 What happened to me? 
 Well, you sort of went... rigid. We thought maybe you were having a fit or
    something. 
 And did either of you? You know... pass out? 
 No. I felt... weird. Like I'd never be cheerful again. But... no. 
 I was trembling. Cold. But then... Professor Lupin made it go away... 
 But someone was screaming. A woman. 
 No one was screaming, Harry. 
 Welcome! Welcome to another year at Hogwarts! I have a few things to say,
    before we become befuddled by our excellent feast. I myself am particularly looking forward to
    the flaming kiwi cups, which, while somewhat treacherous for those of us with facial hair...
     
 Mm. Yes. First, I'm pleased to welcome Professor R.J. Lupin, who has
    kindly consented to fill the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts. Good luck to you, Professor.
     
 Of course! That's why he knew to give you the chocolate, Harry. 
 As some of you may know, Professor Kettleburn, our Care of Magical
    Creatures teacher for many years, has decided to retire in order to spend more time with his
    remaining limbs. Fortunately, I'm delighted to announce that his place will be filled by none
    other than our own Rubeus Hagrid! 

    
 Finally, on a more disquieting note, Hogwarts -- at the request
    of the Ministry of Magic -- will, until further notice, play host to the Dementors of Azkaban.
     
 The Dementors will be stationed at the entrances to the grounds. While
    they are under strict orders not to enter the castle itself, you will on occasion see them as
    you go about your daily activities. Under no circumstances are you to approach them. It is not
    in the nature of a Dementor to be forgiving. 
 Fortuna Major. 
 Good to be home, eh, Harry? 
 Yeah... 
 Welcome, my children. In this room, you shall
    explore the mysterious art of Divination. In this room, you shall discover if you possess...
     
 ... the Sight. Hello. I am Professor Trelawney. Together, we
    shall cast ourselves into the future. But know this. One either has the Gift or not. It cannot
    be divined from the pages of a book. Books only cloud one's Inner Eye. 

    
 What rubbish. 
 Where'd you come from? 
 Me? I've been here all along. 

    
 You, boy! Is your grandmother well? 
I...I think so. 
 I wouldn't be so sure of that. 
 The
    first term will be devoted to the reading of tea leaves. If all goes well, we will proceed to
    palmistry, fire omens, and finally... the crystal ball. 
 By the
    way, dear, beware a red- haired man. 
 Unfortunately, classes will be disrupted in February by a nasty
    bout of flu. I myself will lose my voice. And in late spring, one of our number will... leave us
    forever. 
 Well then. Shall we? 
 Broaden your minds, my dears. And allow your eyes to see...
    beyond. Trelawney takes Lavender Brown's cup, peers inside. 
 A five-leaf clover... You can expect to wake with a horrible rash
    tomorrow morning, dear. 
 Mr. Longbottom, after you've broken your
    first cup... 
 ... would you be so kind as to select one of the blue ones? I'm
    rather partial to the pink. 
 What do you see in Mr. Potter's cup,
    Mr. Weasley? 
 Well. He's got a wonky sort of cross -- that's trials and suffering. But this lot
    here could be the sun -- that's great happiness. So... he's going to suffer but be very happy
    about it. 
 Ahhh! 
 What is it, Professor? 
 My dear boy... You have the Grim. 
 The Grin? What's the Grin? 
 Not the grin, you idiot. The Grim. 
 But what does it mean, Professor? 
 'The Grim...' 
 'Taking the form of a giant spectral dog, it is among the darkest omens in
    our world. It is an omen... of death.' 
 Death omens. Honestly. If you ask me, Divination's a very wooly discipline.
    Now Ancient Runes. That's a fascinating subject. 
 Ancient Runes? Exactly how many classes are you taking this term? A fair few. 
 
 Hang on. Ancient Runes is the same time as Divination. You'd have to be in two
    classes at once. 
 Don't be silly. How could anyone be in two classes at once?
     
 Broaden your minds... 
 C'mon now, get a move on! Got a real treat for yeh. Great lesson comin' up.
    Follow me. 
 Gather 'round. Find yerself a spot. That's it. Now, firs' thing yeh'll want
    ter do is open yer books -DRACO And exactly how do we do that? 
 Crikey. Didn' yeh know? All yeh've got ter do is stroke 'em. Look --
 Righ' then. So... so... yeh've got yer books, an' now yeh need the Magical
    Creatures. Right. So... I'll... I'll go an' get 'em. 
 God, this place is going to the dogs. Wait until my father hears Dumbledore's
    got this oaf teaching classes. 
 Listen, you stupid prat -
 Potter, there's a Dementor behind you. 
 Gee up, there! 
 Beau'iful, isn' he? 
 Hagrid. Exactly what is that? 
 A Hippogriff, o' course. Now, firs' thing yeh gotta know is they're proud.
    Easily offended, Hippogriffs are. Don't never insult one, 'cause it migh' be the las' thing yeh
    do. Right then -- who wants ter come an' say hello? 
 Good man, Harry! 
 Tha's it. Easy now... stop! This here's Buckbeak, Harry. Yeh want ter let 'im
    make the firs' move. It's polite, see? Jus' take step forward, give 'im a bow, and if Buckbeak
    bows back, yeh're allowed ter touch him. Ready? 
 Back off, Harry! Back off! 
 Well done, Harry! Go on. Give 'im a pat. 
 Look at that! I reckon he migh' let yeh ride 'im! 

    
 Excuse me? 
 We'll jus' set yeh behind the wing joint. Mind yeh don' pull any feathers out.
    He won' like that. 
 Off yeh go! 
 Good work, Harry! 
 How'm I doin' me firs'
    day? 
 Brilliant... Professor. 
 Give me a go at that thing. If Potter can do it, it must be easy. You're not
    dangerous at all, are you, you great ugly brute -- Malfoy! No! 
 In a flash, Buckbeak's steely talons SLASH DOWN. Malfoy freezes. Looks down at
    the BLOOD BLOSSOMING on his robes. SHRIEKS. Instantly, Harry dashes forward. Buckbeak WHIPS
    AROUND, raises its talons and -- seeing Harry -- lowers them. Ducks its beak. Harry... realizing
    what he's done... breathes. 
 It's killed me! It's killed me! Calm yerself! a scratch... 
 Yer fine... jus' Hagrid looks: arm. a DEEP GASH glistens on Draco's limp 
 Hagrid. He's got to be taken to a hospital. I'll go with you, if you like
    -HAGRID No. I'm the teacher. You all... you all just... Class dismissed! And with that, Hagrid
    -- looking shaken -- swoops up Malfoy, flops him over his shoulder, and lumbers toward the
    castle. 
 Does it hurt terribly, Draco? 

    
 It comes and goes. Still... I consider myself lucky. According
    to Madam Pomfrey, another minute or two... and I could've lost the arm. 
 The little git. He's really laying it on thick, isn't he? 
 At least Hagrid didn't get sacked. 
 Yes. But I hear Draco's father's furious. I don't think we've heard the end
    of this... 
 He's been sighted! 
 Who? 
 Achintee? That's not far from here... 
 You don't think he'd come to Hogwarts, do you? 
 With the Dementors at every entrance? 
 Dementors? He's already slipped by them once, hasn't he? Who's to say he
    can't do it again? 
 That's right. Black could be anywhere. It's like trying to catch smoke. Like
    trying to catch smoke with your bare hands. 
 Intriguing, yes? Would anyone like to venture a guess as to what's
    inside? 

    
 That's a Boggart, that is. 
 Very good, Mr. Finnigan. Can anyone tell us what a Boggart looks
    like? No one knows. 
 Ron JUMPS, glances at Hermione, then WHISPERS to Harry. 
 When'd she get here? 
 Boggarts are shape-shifters. They take the shape of whatever a particular
    person fears most. That's what makes it so - 
 Terrifying, yes. Luckily, a very simple charm exists to repel a
    Boggart. Let's practice it now, shall we? Without wands, please... Riddikulus! 
 Riddikulus! 

    
 It's this class that's ridiculous. 
 Good. So much for the easy part. You see, the incantation alone is
    not enough. What really finishes a Boggart off is... laughter. You need to force it to assume a
    shape you find truly amusing. Neville, come up here, will you? 
 What would you say is the thing that frightens you most? 
 Profter... Snafpt... 
 Didn't catch that, Neville, sorry. 
 Professor Snape. 
 Hmmm... yes. Neville, I believe you live with your grandmother? 
 Yes, but I don't want the Boggart to turn into her either. 
 It won't. But I want you to picture her clothes, only her clothes,
    very clearly in your mind. Can you do that? 

    
 She carries a red handbag... 
 That's fine. We don't need to hear it. If you see it, we will. Now,
    when I open this wardrobe, Neville, here's what I want you to do... 
 You can do this, Neville. 
 Right then. Wand at the ready. One. Two. Three! 
 Think, Neville. Think! 
 R-r-riddikulus! 
 Ron! Forward! 
 Riddikulus! 
 Parvati! 
 Riddikulus! 
 Mr. Thomas! As Dean steps up, the vampire's undulating body
    attenuates, its skin darkening with diamond-thatched SCALES becoming... a GIANT COBRA. 
 Riddikulus! 
 Next! 
 Here! 
 Riddikulus! 
 Well done, everyone. I think that's enough excitement for today.
     
 Remember! These visits to Hogsmeade Village are a privilege. Should your
    behavior reflect poorly on the school in any way, that privilege shall not be extended again.
     
 No permission form.
    No visiting the Village. That's the rule, Potter. 
 Yes, Professor, but I thought if you said I could go - 
 But I don't say so. A parent or guardian must sign, and since I am
    neither, it would be inappropriate. 
 I'm sorry, Potter. But
    that's my final word. 
 So. No Hogsmeade, eh ? 
 Well, don't feel too bad. I was roundly disappointed the first time I
    went. Really? 
 
 No. I was just trying to make you feel better. Honeydukes' sweets are
    the best in the world. Their Pepper Imps are so strong you smoke at the ears. And Zonko's Joke
    Shop may be dangerous, but you can't beat their Stink Pellets. 

    
 Not to mention The Shrieking Shack, which, according to
    Hermione, is the most severely haunted building in Britain. 
 Yes, that too... 
 Professor, can I ask you something? 
 You'd like to know why I stopped you from facing the Boggart.
     
 I should think it'd be obvious. I assumed the Boggart
    would take the shape of Lord Voldemort. 
 But clearly... I was wrong. 
 I did think of Voldemort first. But then, I remembered that night on the
    train... and the Dementors... 
 Well, well. I'm impressed. That suggests that what you fear most of
    all is... fear. Very wise. 
 Before I fainted... I heard something. A woman. Screaming. 
 Dementors force us to relive the worst memories of our lives. Our
    pain becomes their power. 
 I think it was my mother. The night she was murdered. 
 The first time I saw you, Harry, I recognized you immediately. Not by
    your scar. By your eyes. They're your mother Lily's. 
 Yes. I knew her.
    She was there for me at a time when no one else was. We used to talk for hours. She was not only
    a singularly gifted witch but an uncommonly kind woman. She had a way of seeing the beauty in
    whoever she met, even -- and perhaps most especially -- when that person couldn't see it in
    themselves... 
 Which perhaps explains her affection for your father. James had,
    shall we say, a certain talent for trouble. A gift, rumor has it, he passed on to you. 
 I could tell you stories -- and there are many about your parents,
    Harry -- but know this... 
 They lived. Every moment of
    every day. You should know that. That's how they'd want to be remembered. 
 And the post office! It's about owls, all sitting on color- coded shelves,
    depending on how fast you want your letter to go! 
 And Honeyduke's is brilliant! Sugar Quills, Flaming Whizbees -and blood-flavored
    lollipops for Halloween! 
 But, I mean, after awhile, it got a bit boring. Don't you think, Ron? 
 Huh? Oh. Yeah. Dead depressing. Hang on. I almost forgot. I got you something
    wicked at Dervish and Banges. It's a Pocket Sneakoscope. 
 If there's someone untrustworthy around, it's meant to light up and spin. Mind
    you, Fred and George say it's rubbish, sold for wizard tourists, but I thought, you know, it
    can't hurt, given that... 
 Sirius Black's trying to kill me. 
 I'm glad you had a good time. Really. And thanks for this. 
 Rubbish or not, you're right. It can't hurt. 
 Oh, careful of those, they'll make your... 
 Never mind. 
 What's the hold-up? Only Neville ever forgets the password. 

    
 Let me through, please. Excuse me, thank you, I'm Head Boy...
     
 Back! All of you! No one is to enter this dormitory until it has
    been fully searched! 
 The Fat Lady... she's gone. 
 Probably stuffing her face with the apples in that still life on the second floor
    again. 
 No. You don't understand -
 Mr. Filch. Round up the ghosts. Tell them to search every painting in the
    castle for the Fat Lady. 
 There'll be no need for ghosts, Professor... 
 Dear lady. Who did this to you? 

    
 Eyes like the devil he's got. And a soul as dark as his name. It
    was him, Headmaster. The one they talk about. He's here. Somewhere in the castle. Sirius Black.
     
 I've done the dungeons, Headmaster. No sign of Black. Nor anywhere else in the
    castle. 

    
 I didn't really expect him to linger. 
 Remarkable feat, don't you think? To enter Hogwarts castle on one's own,
    completely undetected... 
 You may recall, prior to the start of term, I did express my concerns when you
    appointed Professor - 
 I do not believe a single professor inside this castle would have helped
    Sirius Black enter it, Severus. 
 No... I feel quite confident the castle is safe. And I'm more than willing
    to let the students return to their Houses. But tomorrow. For now, let them sleep... 
 It's astonishing what the body can endure when the mind allows itself to
    rest. 
 What villains are these that trespass upon my private
    lands! 
 Who dares challenge Sir Cadogan! Back, you scurvy braggarts! You rogues! 
 He's barking mad! 
 What d'you expect? After what happened to the Fat Lady, none of the other
    pictures would take the job. 
 But he keeps changing the password. Twice just this morning! I've taken to
    keeping a list. 
 Farewell, comrades! If ever you have need of noble heart and steely
    sinew, call upon Sir Cadogan! 
 Yeah, we'll call you... if we ever need someone mental. 
 Turn to page 394.
 Excuse me, sir, but... where's Professor Lupin? 
 That's not really your concern, is it, Potter? Suffice it to say, your
    Professor finds himself incapable of teaching at the present time. Page 
 Werewolves? 
 But, sir, we've only just begun learning about Red Caps and Hinkypunks.
    We're not meant to start nocturnal beasts for weeks - 
 Quiet! 

    
 When did she come in? Did you see her come in... 
 Now. Which of you can tell me the difference between an Animagus and a
    werewolf? 
 No one? How... disappointing. 
 Please, sir, an Animagus is a wizard who elects to turn into an animal. A
    werewolf has no choice in the matter. Furthermore, the werewolf actively hunts humans and
    responds only to the call of its own kind -- Malfoy lets out a LOW HOWL. 
 Quiet, Malfoy! Though one must admit to feeling your pain. That is the second
    time you have spoken out of turn, Miss Granger. Tell me. Are you incapable of restraining
    yourself? Or do you take pride in being an insufferable know-it-all? 

    
 He's got a point, you know. 
 Five points from Gryffindor! 
 As a antidote to
    your ignorance, I prescribe two rolls of parchment on the werewolf by Monday morning, with
    particular emphasis placed on recognizing it. 
 Passing notes, Potter?
     
 Not exactly Picasso, are you? I hope you demonstrate more talent on the
    Quidditch pitch this weekend then you do as an artist. If not, I fear you'll perish, given the
    weather forecast. Until that time, however, you'll forgive me if I don't let you off homework.
    Should you die, I assure you... you need not hand it in. 
 Come on! Faster! 
 No!!! 
 Looks a bit peaky, doesn't he? 
 Peaky? What d'you expect him to look like? He fell fifty feet. 
 Yeah, c'mon, Ron. We'll walk you off the Astronomy Tower and see how you come
    out looking. 
 Probably a right sight better than he normally does. 
 Harry! How're you feeling? 
 Brilliant. 
 Gave us a right good scare, mate. 
 What happened? 
 You fell off your broom. 
 Really? I meant the match. Who won? 
 No one blames you, Harry. The Dementors aren't meant to come on the grounds.
    Dumbledore was furious. After he saved you, he sent them straight off. 
 There's something else you should know, Harry. Your Nimbus -- when it blew away?
    -- it sort of landed in the Whomping Willow. And well... 
 I'm sorry about your broom, Harry. There's no
    chance of fixing it? 
 Why do they affect me so, Professor? I mean, more than everyone else... 
 Dementors are among the foulest creatures that walk this earth. They
    feed on every good feeling, every happy memory, until a person is left with nothing but his
    worst experiences. You're not weak, Harry. The Dementors affect you most, because there are true
    horrors in your past. Horrors your classmates can scarcely imagine. You have nothing to be
    ashamed of. 
 I'm scared, Professor. 
 I'd consider you a fool if you weren't. 
 I need to learn how to fight them. You could teach me, Professor. You made that
    Dementor on the train go away... 
 There was only one that night... 
 But you made it go away. 

    
 I don't pretend to be an expert, Harry. But yes, I can teach you.
    Perhaps after the holiday. For now, though, I need to rest. I'm feeling... tired. Harry turns,
    studies Lupin's haggard face. A weary smile appears as Hedwig's reflection glides over Lupin's
    irises. Beautiful... 
 Harry looks up, watches Hedwig pinwheel through the blue, past the
    CLOCK TOWER and EXIT FRAME. CAMERA HOLDS, the skies PALES, and SNOW begins to fall. We TILT
    DOWN... 
 Clever, Harry. 
 But not clever enough. 
 Besides, we've got a better way. 
 What's this rubbish? 
 Rubbish he says. That there's the secret to our success. 
 It's a wrench giving it to you, believe me. 
 But we've decided your need's greater than ours. George, if you will... 
 I solemnly swear that I am up to no good. George touches his wand to the
    parchment and INTRICATE INK LINES surface in the fiber of the paper, spread like veins. Harry
    reads the CURIOUS WORDS at the top: 
 'Messrs Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs are proud to present The Marauder's
    Map'...? 
 Ah... Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs. We owe them so much. 
 Hang on. This is Hogwarts! And that... No. Is that really... Harry points to a
    small MOVING DOT labeled "Dumbledore." 
 Dumbledore. 
 In his study. 
 Pacing. 
 Does that a lot. 
 You mean, this map shows... 
 Everyone. 
 Everyone? 
 Everyone. 
 Where they are. 
 What they're doing. 
 Every minute. 
 Of every day. 
 Brilliant! Where'd you get it? 
 Nicked it from Filch's office, of course, first year. Now listen. There's seven
    secret passageways out of the castle. But we'd recommend... 
 This one. 
 The One-Eyed... 
 Witch, right. But you best hurry. Filch is heading this way. 
 Oh. And, Harry? When you're done, make sure to give it a tap and say, 'Mischief
    managed.' Otherwise, anyone can read it. 
 Dissendium? 
 Mischief managed. 
 A box of Jelly Slugs as well, Horace. We're nearly cleared
    out. HORACE grunts, begins moving boxes. Harry looks up to the cellar door, takes out the
    invisibility cloak... 
 It's meant to be the most haunted building in Britain. Did I mention that?
    Twice. 
 
 Should we move a bit closer? Huh? 
 Oh... All right... 
 Actually, it's fine from here. 
 Perfect. 
 Well, well. Look who's here. You two shopping for your dream home? Seems a bit
    grand for you, Weasel- Bee. Don't your family all sleep in one room? 
 Shut your mouth, Malfoy. 

    
 Now that's not very friendly. Boys, I think we're going to
    have to teach Weasel-Bee to respect his superiors. 

    
 Hope you don't mean yourself. 
 How dare you speak to me, you filthy, little mud -
 Who did that! 
 Well, don't just stand there! 
 Wait a minute, there's something out here -- Aaaaaaahhhh!!! 
 Harry...? Harry? 
 Bloody hell, Harry! That was not funny! 
 Those weasels! Never told me about any Marauder's Map! 
 But Harry isn't going to keep it. He's going to turn it over to Professor
    McGonagall, aren't you? 
 Oh sure. Along with his invisibility cloak, his pack of exploding snap cards, his
    - 
 Oh, shut up. 
 Rosmerta, m'dear! 
 That's Madam Rosmerta. Ron fancies her. 
 It's not true! 
 Shhh. 
 I trust business is good? 
 It'd be a right sight better if the Ministry wasn't sending Dementors
    into my pub every other night. 
 We have a killer on the loose. 
 Sirius Black? In Hogsmeade! And what would bring him here? 
 Harry Potter. 
 Harry Potter! 
 Harry? 
 So I says to him, 'Careful, Ned. Don't want to go losing your head!' 
 Come on then. Let's hear it. 
 Years ago, when Harry Potter's parents were marked for death, they went
    into hiding. Few knew where they were. One who did was black. And he told... 
 You-Know-Who. I've heard this rot. It was all over The Daily Prophet
    back in the day. And I'll say now what I said then: Of all the boys I ran out of here, Black's
    the last who would've gone over to the dark side. Hearsay. That's all the Ministry had. Hearsay. 
 Ha! Tell that to Peter Pettigrew! 
 Peter Pettigrew? 
 Little lump of a boy? Always tagging after Black and... 
 I remember him. What's he got to do with it? 
 After the Potters were killed, Pettigrew went looking for Black. And,
    unfortunately... found him. 
 Black was vicious. He didn't kill Pettigrew. He destroyed him. A
    finger. That's all that was left. A finger -- there's your hearsay. Rosmerta looks to
    McGonagall. She nods grimly. 
 Sirius Black may not have put his hands to the Potters, but he's the
    reason they're dead. And now he wants to finish what he started. 
 Harry. 
 But that's not the worst of it. 
 What could be worse? 
 This: Sirius Black was and remains today... Harry Potter's godfather.
     
 He was their friend. And he betrayed them. He was their friend. 
 I hope he finds me. But when he does, I'm going to be ready. When he does,
    I'm going to kill him. 
 You're sure about this, Harry? This is very advanced magic. Well
    beyond Ordinary Wizarding Level. 
 If Black can fight the Dementors, I need to know how too. 
 Very well. The spell I'm going to teach you is called the Patronus
    Charm. Ever hear of it? 
 A Patronus is a kind of positive force. For the wizard who can
    conjure one, the Patronus works something like a shield. The Dementor feeds on it instead of
    him. 
 But in order for it to work, you must think of a memory. And not just
    any. This memory needs to be a very happy one. And powerful. 
 Got something? Good. Let it fill you up. Lose yourself in it. Then
    speak the incantation: Expecto Patronum. Without your wand... 
 Expecto Patronum... 
 Right then. Shall we? 
 Concentrate, Harry. Concentrate... 
 Expecto... Patronum... 
 Expecto... Expecto... 
 Here! 
 Riddikulus! 
 Quickly. 
 That's one nasty Dementor. 
 Boggart, Harry. The real thing would be much, much worse. Just out of
    interest, what were you thinking of? What memory did you choose? 
 The first time I rode a broom. 
 That's not good enough, Harry. Not nearly. 
 There's another. It's not happy exactly. I mean, it is. It's the happiest I've
    ever felt. But it's... complicated. 
 Is it strong? 
 Then let's try it. 
 Think, Harry, think - 
 Just do it! 
 Expecto Patronum! 
 Riddikulus! 
 Well done. 
 
 I think I've had enough. today. For Lupin nods. Watches Harry move to the door. 
 So you know, Harry: You'd have given your father a run for his money.
    And, believe me, that's saying something. Harry ponders this. Then speaks, deep inside himself. 
 I was thinking of him. And Mum. Seeing their faces. They're just talking to me.
    Just... talking. That was the memory I chose. I don't even know if it's real... 
 But it's the best I have. 
 Aaaahhhh! 
 Everybody out! 
 Show yourself. 
 Ron! Ron! 
 Is he gone? 
 That's preposterous, Weasley. How could Sirius Black possibly have got
    through the portrait hole? 
 I don't know how he got in! I was a bit busy dodging his knife! 
 And this bloody cat ate my rat! 
 That's a lie! 
 It is not and you bloody well know it! 
 Silence! 
 Sir Cadogan. Is it possible that you let a mysterious man enter Gryffindor
    Tower tonight? 
 Certainly, good lady! He had the 
 Which abysmally foolish person wrote down the passwords and then proceeded
    to lose them! 
 Is it always going to be you, Longbottom? 
 I'm afraid so, ma'am. 

    
 While we know Sirius Black is gone tonight, I think you
    can safely assume he will, at some future time, attempt to return. Let me be clear. You are not
    to move about the castle alone. And you are not to write down the password! Understood! 
 Very well then. Go to bed. 
 I could've killed him. 
 He was right there. Close enough to touch. I could've killed him. 
 I find it astonishing that someone who prides herself on being so logical can be
    in such denial. 
 Harry. Will you explain to your friend Ronald that he has absolutely no
    proof whatsoever that my sweet, unassuming cat ate his shabby, decidedly decrepit rat. 
 Harry was there! He'll tell you how it was. Go on, Harry, tell her. 
 No, I won't. Know why? Because I don't care about your stupid rat! I don't care
    about your stupid cat! I've got few other things on my mind right now! 
 Really? Wasn't you had to roll under the bed last night to avoid getting cut to
    ribbons! A person could die being your friend, Harry! 
 How'd it go, Hagrid? 
 Buckbeak liked London. 
 I meant the hearing. 
 Oh. That. Well, I got up an' said my bit -- You know, how Buckbeak was a good
    Hippogriff an' as long as yeh treated 'im with respect, he'd treat you the same. Then Lucius
    Malfoy got up an' said his bit -- you know, how Buckbeak was a deadly dangerous beast that no
    teacher in their righ' mind would expose their students to... 

    
 And...? 
 You mustn't blame yourself, Hagrid. 
 Draco. It's him the Committee should punish. It's him they should send off to the
    forest, not Buckbeak. 
 Buckbeak's not going back to the forest... 

    
 Where's he going, Hagrid? 
 He asked fer the worse, yeh see, Lucius Malfoy did. An' the Committee granted
    it. Buckbeak's bin sentenced ter death. 
 I solemnly swear that I am up to no good. 
 Watch it there, boy! 
 Mischief managed! 
 Potter. What're you doing wandering the corridors at night? 
 I was... I was... sleepwalking... 
 How extraordinarily like your father you are, Potter. He, too, was exceedingly
    arrogant. Strutting about the castle - 
 My dad didn’t strut. Nor do I. Now, if you don't mind, I'd appreciate you
    lowering your wand. 
 Turn out your pockets. 
 Turn out your pockets! 
 And this. What might it be? 
 Spare bit of parchment... 
 Really... 
 Reveal your secret! 
 Read it. 
 'Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs offer their compliments to
    Professor Snape and...' 
 Go on. 
 '... and request that he keep his abnormally large nose out of other people's
    business.' 

    
 Why you insolent little - 
 Professor...? 

   
 Well, well. Lupin. Out for a little walk in the moonlight, are we? Harry? 
 You all right? 
 That remains to be seen. I've just now confiscated a rather curious artifact
    from Mr. Potter. Take a look, Lupin. This is supposed to be your area of expertise. 
 Clearly, it's full of Dark Magic. 
 I seriously doubt that, Severus. It looks to me as if it merely
    insults anyone who tries to read it. I suspect it's a Zonko product. Nevertheless, I shall
    pursue any hidden qualities it may possess. As you say, it's my area of expertise. Come, Harry.
   
 I don't know how this map came to be in your possession, Harry, but
    I'm astounded that you didn't turn it in. Did you ever stop to think that this -- in the hands
    of Sirius Black -- is a map to you? 
 Your father didn't set much store by rules either. But he and your
    mother did give their lives to save yours. Gambling their sacrifice by walking about the castle
    unprotected, with a killer on the loose, strikes me as a poor way to repay them. I won't cover
    up for you again, Harry. 
 Professor. Just so you know, I don't think the map always works. Earlier, it
    showed someone in the castle. Someone I know to be dead. 

    
 And who was that, Harry? 
 Peter Pettigrew. 
 Very well. I'd like you to return to your dormitory now. Oh, and
    Harry? Don't take any detours. 
 If you do. I'll know. 
 Relax... Let your mind... go... 
 Crystal-gazing requires that you clear the Inner Eye. Only then,
    will you... See. Oh my, what do we have here...? 
 Here we go again. It's the Grim! It's the Grim! 

    
 My dear, from the moment you first arrived in my class, I sensed
    that you did not possess the proper spirit for the noble art of Divination. You may be young in
    years, but the heart that beats beneath your bosom is as shriveled as an old maid's, your soul
    as dry as the pages of the books to which you so desperately cleave. 
 'In late spring, one of our number will leave us forever!' You knew,
    Professor! You saw. 
 On these occasions, I take no joy in my gift, Miss Brown. 
 She's gone mental, Hermione has. I mean, not that she wasn't always mental, but
    now it's out in the open for everyone to see... 
 Professor Trelawney - 
 He will return tonight.... 
 S-sorry? 
 Tonight, when the clock strikes twelve, the servant shall break
    free. He and his Master shall be reunited. It cannot be prevented. 
 So sorry, dear boy. Did you say something? Her voice is normal
    once more. Harry shakes his head. 
 No. Nothing. 
 I can't believe they're going to kill Buckbeak! It's too horrible. 
 It just got worse. 
 Did you see the big, fat blubbering oaf?! Oh, this is going to be rich. Did I
    tell you, Father said I can keep the head - 
 Ah. Come to see the
    show? 
 You... foul... loathsome... evil... little cockroach... 
 Hermione! No! 
 He's not worth it. 
 That felt good. 
 Look at 'em. Loves the smell o' the trees when the wind blows... 
 I say we set him free. 

    
 They'd know I did it. And tha' would only get Dumbledore in
    trouble. Gonna come down, yeh know. Says he wants ter be with me when it... when it happens.
    Great man, Dumbledore. 
 We'll stay with you too, Hagrid. 
 Yeh will not! Think I wan' yeh seein' a thing like this! No. Yeh'll drink yer
    tea an' be off. But before yeh do -- I wan' ter see you an' Ron shake hands, Harry. 
 Thin' I haven' seen 'ow it's bin betw'n you two? Go on now... 
 Good. Now then. Ron, I wan' ter see you give Hermione a hug. 
 What! 
 Go on! You two've been at it all year. An' I'm sick o' it. 
 Crikey, tha's jus' abou' the most pathetic hug I e'er seen. But yeh did it,
    an' tha's wha' matters. There's jus' one other thing... 
 I'm not kissing Fang if that's what you're thinking... 
 Scabbers! You're alive! 
 Yeh should keep a closer eye on yer pets, Ron. 
 I think you owe someone an apology. 
 Right. Next time I see Crookshanks, I'll let him know. 
 I meant me. 
 Crikey. Here we go agin... 
 Ow! 
 Hagrid... 
 Yeh got to go! It's almost dark. Anyone sees yeh outside the castle it'll be
    trouble! Big trouble! 'Specially you, Harry -
 C'mon. 
 What? 
 Nothing, I just thought I saw... Never mind. 
 He bit me... 
 Ron! No! 
 Harry. You do realize what tree this is... 
 Now behave yourself. 
 That's not good. 
 Ron! Run! 
 Harry! Run! 
 Aaaahhh! 
 I've got you -
 Harry! 
 Hold on, Ron! 
 No, Ron... 
 Nooooo!!! 
 Haaaaaaarrrrrr!!!!!!!!! 
 Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! 
 Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! 
 Thanks. 
 Don't mention it. Lumos. 
 Where do you suppose this goes? 
 I have a hunch. I just hope I'm wrong... 
 We're in the Shrieking Shack, aren't we? 
 Nox. 
 Ron! You're okay - 
 The dog -- where's the - 
 It's a trap, Harry. He's the dog. He's an Animagus... 
 If you want to kill Harry, you'll -- you'll... have to kill us, too! 
 No. Only one will die tonight. 
 Then it'll be you! 
 Harry! No! 
 Going to kill me, Harry? 
 Yes. 

   
 Professor Lupin! 

   
 Looking a bit ragged, aren't we, Sirius? Finally the skin reflects
    the madness within. 
 You'd know all about the madness within, wouldn't you, Remus? 
 No! I trusted you! I covered up for you. And all this time you've been his
    friend! 
 He's a werewolf! That's why he's been missing classes! 
 How long have you known? 
 Since Professor Snape set the essay. 
 You're the brightest witch of your age I've ever met, Hermione. 
 Yes, you glow like the sun. And you howl at the moon. Enough talk! He
    dies. Now. If you won't do it with me, Remus, I'll do it alone. 
 Wait, Sirius - 
 I did my waiting! Twelve years of it! In Azkaban! Trust me, you wouldn't
    have lasted a week! 
 All right then. As you wish... 
 No! 
 You betrayed my parents! You sold them to Voldemort! 
 It's a lie! I never would've betrayed James and Lily! 
 Harry! You've got to listen - 
 Did he listen! When my mother was dying! Did he hear her screaming! 
 No! I wasn't there! And I'll regret it the rest of my life! Harry's eyes
    flash to Black's, glittering with pain. 
 Someone else betrayed your parents, Harry. Someone in this room right
    now. Someone who, until quite recently, I believed to be dead. 
 He's as good as dead. 
 What're you talking about? There's nobody here. 
 Oh yes there is... 
 Come out, come out, Peter Come out, come out and play... 
 You're mad... 
 Expelliarmus! 

    
 Ah, vengeance is sweet. How I hoped I'd be the one to catch you. 
 Severus - 
 I told Dumbledore you were helping your old friend into the castle. And here's
    the proof. 
 Brilliant! And -- as usual -dead wrong. Now give us our wands back.
    Remus and I have a bit of unfinished business to tend to. 
 Give me a reason. I beg you. 
 Don't be a fool, Severus! 
 He can't help it. It's habit by now. 
 Quiet, Sirius! 

    
 Listen to you two. Quarreling like an old married couple.
    The creature and the criminal. 
 Piss off. 
 Witty as ever I see. Tell me, will you be so irreverent when I turn you over to
    the Dementors? 
 Do I detect a flicker of fear? One can only
    imagine what it must be like to endure the Dementor's Kiss. It's said to be unbearable to
    witness. But I'll do my best. 
 After you. 
 Expelliarmus! 
 Harry. You attacked a teacher. 
 You said Peter before. Peter who? 
 Pettigrew. He was at school with us. We thought he was a friend. 
 No. Pettigrew's dead. He killed him. 
 I thought so, too. Until you mentioned seeing Pettigrew on the Map. 
 The Map was lying then - 
 The Map never lies. Pettigrew's alive. And he's right there. 
 M-me? It's lunatic... 
 Not you, you idiot. Your rat. 
 Scabbers? Scabbers has been in my family for - 

    
 Twelve years. A curiously long life for a common garden rat. He's
    missing a toe, isn't he? 
 So what? 
 All they could find of Pettigrew was his - 
 Finger. Dirty coward cut it off so everyone would think he was dead.
    Then he transformed into a rat. 
 Show me. 
 What are you going to do to him? 
 Together. 
 
 S-Sirius... R-Remus. My old friends. 
 Harry! Look at you! Y-you look just like your father. Like James. We were
    the best of friends, he and I - 
 Shut up! 
 I didn't mean to! The Dark Lord, you have no idea the weapons he possesses!
    Ask yourself what you would have done, Sirius. What would you have done! 
 Died! Died rather than betray my friends! And you should have realized,
    Peter, if Voldemort didn't kill you... 
 We would. 
 No... please... you can't... 
 Ron!
    Haven't I been a good friend? A good pet? You won't let them kill me, will you? I was your
    rat... 
 Sweet girl. Clever girl. Surely you won't let them... 
 No. 
 Harry, this man... 
 I know what he is. But we'll take him to the castle. 
 Bless you, boy! Bless you - 
 Get off! I said we'd take you to the castle. After that, the Dementors can have
    you. 
 Turn me into a maggot. A dung beetle. A Flobberworm! Anything but the
    Dementors... 
 Ron! Haven't I been a good friend? A good pet? You
    won't let them kill me, will you? I was your rat... 
 Don't worry. He's under the Somnambulist Charm. It's primarily used to
    transport the seriously deranged. 
 Sweet girl. Clever girl. Surely you won't let them... 
 Beautiful, isn't it? I'll never forget the first time I walked through
    those doors. It'll be nice to do it again. Freely. 
 That was a
    noble thing you did back there. He doesn't deserve it. 
 I don't reckon my father'd want his best friends to become killers for a
    worthless piece of vermin like Pettigrew. Besides: Dead, the truth dies with him. Alive...
    you're free. 
 I don't know if you know, Harry, but when you were born, James and Lily
    made me your guardian... 
 I know. 
 And, well, I'll understand if you choose to stay with your aunt and
    uncle, but, so you know, you could - 
 Come live with you? When! 
 Soon as my name's cleared... 
 Harry... 
 Remus, old friend... did you take your potion tonight? 
 Run. All of you. Now. 
 You know the man you truly are, Remus. This flesh is only flesh.
     
 This heart is where you truly live. This heart! Here!
     
 No! 
 Expelliarmus! 
 Professor...? 
 Out of the way! 
 Sirius! 
 Harry! 
 NO!!! 
 Please, Professor. Stop... It's me. 
 Sirius! 
 Sirius! 
 No... No! 
 Expecto... Patronum! 
 Expecto... Patronum... 
 Harry - 
 I saw my dad. 
 What...? 
 He sent the Dementors away... I saw him. Across the lake... 
 Listen, Harry. They've captured Sirius. Any minute the Dementors are going
    to perform the Kiss. 
 The Kiss...? 
 It's what Dementors do to those they want to destroy. They clamp their jaws
    over the victim's mouth and... suck out his soul. 
 You mean, they're going to kill Sirius? 
 No. It's worse. Much worse. You go on living. But you have no memory. No
    sense of self. You're just a shall. An empty shell... 
 Headmaster! You've got to stop them! They've got the wrong man! 
 It's true, sir. Sirius is innocent - 
 It's Scabbers who did it! 
 Scabbers...? 
 My rat, sir. Only he's not really a rat. Well, he was a rat. You see, he used to
    be my brother Percy's - 
 The point is... we know the truth. Please, sir, you must believe us. 
 I do, Miss Granger. But I'm sorry to say the word of three thirteen
    year-old wizards will convince few others. A child's voice, however honest and true, is
    meaningless to those who have forgotten how to listen. 
 Ah... a shooting star. If ever one was to make a wish, now would be the
    time. But time, I'm afraid, is precisely our problem... 
 Mysterious thing, time. Powerful. And, when meddled with... dangerous.
    Sirius Black is in the topmost cell of the Dark Tower. 
 You know the
    laws, Miss Granger. You must not be seen. And you would, I feel, do well to return before this
    last chime. If not... well, the consequences are really too ghastly to discuss. Three turns
    should do it, I think. If you succeed, more than one innocent life may be spared tonight.
     
 By the way, when in doubt, I find retracing my steps to be a wise place to
    begin... Good luck. 
 What in bloody hell was all that about? 
 Sorry, Ron. But seeing as you can't walk... 
 What just happened? Where's Ron? 
 Seven-thirty. Where were we at seven-thirty? 
 Huh? Dunno... going to Hagrid's? 
 Come on! We can't be seen! 
 Hermione! Will you please tell me what it is we're doing?! 
 But that... that's... us. This is not... normal. 
 This is a Time-Turner, Harry. McGonagall gave it to me first term. This is
    how I've been getting to my lessons all year. 
 You mean, we've gone back in time? 
 Yes. Dumbledore wanted us to return to this moment. Clearly something
    happened he wants us to change. 

    
 Good punch. Hurry! 
 Malfoy's coming!
 Not a word of this to anyone, understood! I'll get that
    jumped- up Mudblood one of these days. Mark my words... 
 Buckbeak's still alive. 
 Of course! Remember what Dumbledore said. If we succeed, more than one
    innocent life could be spared. 
 Buckbeak? But... how will saving Buckbeak help Sirius? 
 We'll see. 
 What? 
 Nothing. 
 Here they come. I better hurry. 
 No! Fudge has to see Buckbeak before we steal him. Otherwise, he'll think
    Hagrid set him free! 
 That's Pettigrew -
 No, Harry! You can't! 
 Hermione, that's the man who betrayed my parents! You don't expect me to just
    sit here... 
 Yes! You Must! 
 Harry, you're in Hagrid's
    hut right now. If you go bursting inside, you'll think you've gone mad. Awful things can happen
    when wizards meddle with time. We can't be seen. 
 Fudge is coming and... we're not leaving... why aren't we leaving? 
 Are you mad? 
 That hurt. 
 Sorry. 
 C'mon. Any minute now we're going to be coming out the back door. 
 Is that really what my hair looks like from the back? 
 Shhh! 
 Nothing, I just thought I saw... Never mind. 
 Now, Harry! 
 'It is the decision of the Committee for the
    Disposal of Dangerous Creatures that the Hippogriff Buckbeak, hereafter called the condemned,
    shall be executed this day at sundown...' 
 Get away! 
 'The Committee's appointed executioner shall
    dispatch the condemned by means of beheading...' 
 C'mon, Buckbeak. Come on... 
 'As witnessed below.' You sign here, Hagrid. Very
    well, gentlemen. Let's step outside, shall we... 
 Excuse me, Minister. I believe I must sign as well...
     
 Here, Beaky... Come and get the nice dead ferret... yum yum... 
 Professor Dippet had those blackberries planted when he was Headmaster...
     
 Let's get this over with, shall we? 
 But... where is it? I just saw the beast not moments ago -- Hagrid? 
 Beaky... 

    
 How extraordinary! 
 Come now, Dumbledore. Someone's obviously released him. 
 Professor, I swear! I didn't! 
 I'm quite sure the Minister isn't suggesting that you had anything to do
    with it, Hagrid. How could you? You've been with us all along. 
 We should search the grounds - 
 Search the skies if you must, Minister. In the meantime, I wouldn't say no
    to a cup of tea, Hagrid. Or... a large brandy. 
 It seems your
    services will no longer be required. 
 Now what? 
 We save Sirius. 
 And we do that... how? 
 No idea. 
 Look. It's Lupin. 
 Here comes Snape. 
 And now we wait. 
 Now we wait. 
 'Least someone's enjoying himself. 
 Hermione... 
 Yes? 
 Before. Down by the lake. When I was with Sirius... I did see someone... that
    someone made the Dementors go away... 
 With a Patronus. I heard Snape telling Dumbledore when we were taken to the
    hospital. According to him, only a really powerful wizard could have conjured it. 
 It was my Dad. 
 It was my Dad who conjured the Patronus. 
 But, Harry, your Dad's... 
 Dead. I know. I'm just telling you what I saw. 
 
 You see Sirius talking to me? He's asking me to come live with him. 
 Really? 
 When we free him, I'll never have to go back to the Dursley's. I'm going to
    tell him I'd like to live someplace in the country. I think he'd like that, after all those
    years in Azkaban. We don't need a big place and I can help him... 
 It's happened. Lupin's transformed. 
 Which means Pettigrew is slipping safely into the night. While we just stand
    here... 
 OWWWWWWWWW!
 What are you doing? 
 Saving your life. 
 OWWWWWWWW! 

   
 Thanks. But we have to move. 
 Why? 
 Because that werewolf you just called is running right this way. 
 We've got to find him. 
 Poor Professor Lupin is having a really tough night... 
 Let's go. 
 This is horrible... 
 Don't worry. My Dad will come... Right there... you'll see... he'll come... any
    minute... he'll conjure the Patronus 
 No one's coming, Harry... HE WILL! 
 He will come! 
 No one's coming! You're dying, both of you... and no one's coming! 
 HARRY, NO! 
 EXPECTO PATRONUM! 
 You were right, Hermione. It wasn't my dad I saw earlier. It was... me. I saw
    myself conjuring the Patronus before. I knew I could do it this time, because... because I'd
    already done it. Does that make sense? 
 No. 
 But I don't like this! 
 Out of the way! 
 Alohomora! 
 Didn't really expect that to work. 
 Dunamis! Liberare! Annihilare! Emancipare! No. No. No. No. 
 You might try - 
 Quiet! I'm trying to think. 
 BOMBARDA! 
 That'll do. 
 You truly are your father's son, Harry! 
 I'll be forever grateful for this. To both of you. 
 I want to go with you. 
 One day perhaps. For some time... life will be too... unpredictable.
    Besides, you're meant to be here. 
 But promise me something, Harry. 
 Anything. 
 Trust yourself. No matter the challenges you face -- and I fear they
    will be many -- you'll be surprised how many times you can find the answers... 
 ...here. 
 A shooting star. Make a wish. 
 We have to go. 
 By the way, when in doubt, I always find retracing my steps to be a wise
    place to begin... Good luck. 
 Well? 
 He's free -- Sirius. We... we did it. 
 Did what? 
 How'd you two get over there? I was just talking to you... over there. 
 What d'you think, Harry? Too much for him -- everything that's happened
    tonight? 
 Afraid so. Always been a bit of the nervous type, Ron has. 
 Hello, Harry. 
 Saw you coming. 
 I've looked worse, believe me. 
 You've been sacked. 
 Resigned, actually. 
 Resigned! But why! 
 It seems that someone has let slip the nature of my condition. 
 Snape. 
 Whoever. It was bound to get out. This time tomorrow, the owls will
    start arriving. Parents will not want a --someone like me - teaching their children. 
 But Dumbledore - 
 Has already risked enough on my behalf. Besides, people like me,
    well... let's just say I'm used to this by now. But before I go, tell me about your Patronus. 
 Well. At first I thought it was a horse, or perhaps a unicorn, but I think it
    was - 
 A stag. 
 Yes. 
 Your father used to transform into one. That's how he was able to
    keep me company when I became... sick. He was a great friend James. 
 There are stories about him and your mother, you know. Some are even
    true. But I think it's safe to say in the end, you'll know them best by getting to know
    yourself. 
 Mischief managed. 
 Stand back, I said! I'll take it upstairs if you don't settle! 
 Harry! Wherever did you get it! 
 Can I have a go, Harry? After you, of course - 
 Quiet! 
 Thank you. Let the man through. 
 Whose is that? 

    
 Whose is it? It's yours, mate. 
 But... how? Who? 
 It's a mystery. Though... this fell out of the wrapping. 
 That's a Hippogriff feather -
 Go on, Harry. 
 Yeah. Let's see. 

   
 What's wrong? 
 I don't think it works. I think it's defective. 

   
 Oh, come on now. It's just a broom. 

    

   
 The fastest broom in the world. 
 I should have known you'd be here, Professor McGonagall.
 Are the rumors true, Albus? 

    
 I'm afraid so. The good. And the bad. 
 And the boy? 
 Hagrid's bringing him. 
 You think it ... wise ... to trust Hagrid with something as important as
    this? 
 I would trust Hagrid with my life, Professor. 
 Ev'ning, Professor Dumbledore, sir. Professor McGonagall. 
 No problems, I take it, Hagrid? 
 No sir. Little tyke fell ter sleep as we was flyin' o'er Bristol . 
 Albus, do you really think it best to leave him here; with these people?
    I've been watching them all day. They're the worst sort of Muggles imaginable. They're ... 
 The only family he has. 
 But this boy will be famous. There won't be a child in our world who
    doesn't know his name ... 
 Exactly. It would be enough to turn any boy's head. Famous before he can
    walk and talk. Famous for something he won't even remember. No. He'll be much better off growing
    up away from all that. Until he's ready. 

    
 Up! Now! 
 I said now! 
 There's the birthday boy! Don't you look smart for your trip to the
    zoo. 
 You mind the bacon. And don't dare let it burn. I want
    everything perfect on my Dimplin' s special day . 
 Yes, Aunt Petunia. 
 Bring my coffee, boy. 
 Yes, Uncle Vernon. 
 How many are there? 
 Thirty-six. Counted them myself. 
 Thirty-six. But last year ... last year I had thirty-seven ... 
 Well now, son, some of these are quite a bit bigger than last year- 
 I DON'T CARE HOW BIG THEY ARE! 
 Now, now, here's what we'll do. Today, when we're out, we'll buy you
    two more presents. How's that, popkin? 
 So then I 'll have ... I' ll have ... 
 Thirty-eight, popkin. 
 You just mind that bacon! 
 Yes, Aunt Petunia. 
 Want your money's worth, don't you, tiger. Well, look there. Aunt
    Marge's sent you the Fourth Battalion. 
 This one's lost its head. 
 Well now, son. Remember, we talked about this. They're not meant to
    move ... 
 Bad news. Mrs. Figgs' broken her leg. She can't take him. 
 We could phone Yvonne. 
 Don't be silly. She hates the boy. 
 You could just leave me here. 
 And come back to find the house in ruins? 
 I... Don't... Want... Him... To... Come! He... always... spoils...
    everything! 
 Now, precious, don't cry. He won't spoil anything. What if Mummy buys
    you three more presents. 
 Three? 
 As many as you want, sweetums. 
 I'm warning you now, boy. Any funny business, any at all, and you'll
    have no meals for a week. 
 Make it move. 
 He's asleep. 
 He's boring.· Dudley waddles away and the others follow, all but Harry, who
    steps forward and rubs Dudley's nose print from the glass. 
 Sorry about him. He doesn't understand what it's like, lying there day after
    day, watching people press their ugly faces in on you... 
 Can you hear me? 
 It's just, I've never talked to a snake before. Do you, I mean... do you
    talk to people often? 
 So ... you're from Burma, aren't you? Was it nice there?
    Do you miss your family? 
 I see. That's me as well. I never knew my
    parents either... 
 MUMMY! DAD! COME HERE! You won't what this snake is doing! 
 I swear, I don't know how it happened! One minute the glass was there and then
    it was gone. It was like magic. 
 There's... no ... such... thing... as... magic! 
 Oh, Vernon, look at him. To think in only a week he'll be off to
    Smeltings. 
 Proudest moment of my life. 

    
 Will I have to wear that too? 
 You! Go to Smeltings? Don't be stupid. You'll go to state school, where
    you belong. That there'll be yours, once I'm done dying it. 
 But that's Dudley's old uniform. It'll fit me like bits of old elephant skin. 
 Fit you fine enough. Now fetch the post. 
 Marge's ill. Ate a funny whelk ... 
 Dad! Look! Harry's got a letter! 
 That's mine! 
 Yours. Who'd be writing to you-
 I want my letter! 
 I want my stick! 
 Vernon. Look at the address. How could they possibly know where he
    sleeps? You don't think they're watching the house? 
 Watching. Spying. Following us. We both know the dangerous nonsense your
    sister and her husband were mixed up in. 
 But what should we do, Vernon? Should we write back. Tell them we don't
    want- 
 No. We'll ignore it. If they don't get an answer... Yes, that's best...
    I'll burn it. 
 NO! I WANT MY LETTER! 
 Fine day, Sunday. Best day of the week in my opinion. Know why I say
    that, Dudley? 

    
 Because there's no post on Sundays. 
 Right you are, Harry! No damn letters today! No sir. Not one blasted
    ... 
 Who on earth wants to talk to you this badly! 
 That does it! We're going away! Far away! Where they can't find us!
    Where they can't get to us! 
 Daddy's gone mad, hasn't he? 
 Make a wish, Harry. 
 Who's there'? I warn you--I'm armed! 
 Er, right. Sorry 'bout that ... 

    
 I'm not Harry. 
 I am. 
 Well now, course yeh are. 
 I demand that you leave at once, sir! You are breaking and entering! 
 Ah, dry up, Dursley, yeh great prune. 
 Anyway, Harry. Got summat fer yeh. 'Fraid I mighta sat on it
    at some point, but 'magine it'll taste all right jus' the same... let's see now... got it here
    somewhere ... 
 Baked it meself, words an' all. 
 Thank you . 
 Well, it's not ev'ry day yer young man turns 'leven. 
 Excuse me, but ... who are you? 
 Blimey, Harry, did yeh never wonder where yer parents learnt it all? 
 Learned what? 
 What? DURSLEY!!! Do yeh mean ter tell me the boy knows nothin? 
 I'm a what? 
 A Wizard. And a thumpin' good 'un, I'd wager, once yeh've been trained up a
    bit. 
 No. You've made a mistake. I ... I can't be a ... wizard. I mean ... I'm just
    ... Harry. Just Harry. 
 Tha' right. Tell me, Harry. Ever make somethin' strange 'appen? When yeh was
    scared maybe. Or angry? 
 'Dear Mr. Potter, We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at
    Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry ... ' 
 He'll not be going, I tell you! We swore when we took him in we'd put a
    stop to that rubbish! 
 You knew? You knew I'm a ... a wizard? 
 Of course we knew! How could you not be, my dratted sister being what
    she was? Oh, mother and father were so proud when the letter came. A witch in the family. Isn't
    it wonderful. I was the only one who saw her for what she was ... a freak!
     
 Then she met that Potter and had you. I knew you'd be the same.
    Just as strange, just as abnormal. And then, if you please, she went and got herself blown up
    and we get landed with you- 
 Blown up? You told me my parents died in a car crash. 
 CAR CRASH! A car crash kill Lily and James Potter? It's an outrage! A
    scandal! 
 HE'LL NOT BE GOING, I TELL YOU! 
 An' I s'ppose a great Muggle like yerself is gcin' ter stop him. 
 Muggle? 
 Non-magic folk. 
 This boy's name's
    been down ever since he was born. He's off to the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in
    the world and he'll be under the greatest headmaster Hogwart's has ever known, Albus
    Dumbledore-- 
 I will not pay for some crackpot old fool to teach him magic tricks!
     
 NEVER ... INSULT ALBUS ... ... DUMBLEDORE ... IN ... FRONT... OF ... ME!
     
 
    Tha' s curious. Meant ter turn 'im into a complete pig, whole hog an' all. suppose
     be was so much like a pig already, there wasn't much left ter do. Hagrid sees Harry staring in
     awe at the pink umbrella. Er, be grateful if yeh didn't mention that to anyone at Hogwarts.
     Strictly speakin', I'm not allowed ter do magic. 
 Bit
     behind schedule, aren't we? Best be off. Hagrid exits, leaving Harry to consider his sorry
     surroundings. He looks momentarily at a loss, then ... Hagrid pokes his head back in. 'Less o'
     course, yeh'd rather stay. 
 'First year students will require three sets of plain work robes, one plain
    pointed hat for day wear, one pair of dragon-hide gloves...'
 Things these Muggles dream up ... 
 ' ... and the following Set Books: The Standard Book of Spells by Miranda
    Goshawk. One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi by Phyllida Spore ... ' 
 'One wand, one standard Size 2 pewter cauldron and may bring, if they desire,
    either an owl, a cat, or a toad.' 
 Can we find all this in London?
     
 If yeh know where to go. 
 Hagrid! The usual, I presume 
 Good Lord. Is
    this? Can this be him? Bless my soul. It's Harry Potter. 
 Harry P-P-Potter. C-Can't tell you how p-pleased I am to meet you. 
 Professor! Didn't see yeh there. Harry, this Professor Quirrell. He'll be yer
    Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts. 
 F-F-Fearfully f-fascinating subject. NNot that you n-need it, eh,
    P-P-Potter? 
 Yes, well, must get on. Lots ter buy, 
 See? Tol' yeh you was famous. 
 Why am I famous, Hagrid? All those people back there. How is it they know who
    I am? 
 Don' know that I'm the right one ter tell yeh that, Harry. Let's see now ...
    Three up ... Two across ... Right. Stand back now. 
 Seventeen Sickles an ounce for Dragon Liver, can you imagine? They're
    mad! 
 It says brass, Trevor. As such, you will get brass. 
 There it is! The Nimbus Two Thousand! Runs a good twenty times faster than the
    old Comets. Neil Marks himself rides it for the Chudley Cannons. 
 Mind you don't drop your bottle of eel's eye, Belinda. I'll not buy you
    another. 
 Dragon Liver? Do they mean from a real dragon'? 
 Well, they don't mean a ruddy penguin. Crikey, I'd like a dragon. 
 You'd like a dragon'? 
 Vastly misunderstood beasts, Harry. Vastly misunderstood ... 

    
 But how am I to pay for all this, Hagrid? I haven't
    any money. 
 There's yer money. Gringotts. Wizard's. Bank. No place safer, Harry. Not one.
    'Cept perhaps Hogwarts. 
 Hagrid, what exactly was that? 
 Yer basic Door Goblin. Clever as they come goblins, but not yer most friendly
    beasts. Best stay close. 
 Mornin'. Mr. Harry Potter
    wishes to make a withdrawal. 
 And Mr. Harry Potter has his key? 
 Let's see, got it 'ere somewhere ... 
 Ah, 'ere' s the li' l devil. 

    There's another matter as well. I've got a letter from Professor Dumbledore. It's about the
    You-Know-What in Vault You-Know-Which. 
 Very well. I'll have Griphook take you. 
 Din' think yer parents would leave yeh with nothin', did yeh? 
 Vault Seven Hundred Thirteen. 
 What's in here, Hagrid? 
 Can't tell yeh that, Harry. Hogwarts business. Very secret. 
 Anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that, they'd be sucked through the door. 
 How often do you check to see if anyone's inside? 
 About once every ten years.
 Best not mention this ter anyone either, Harry. 
 I still need ... a wand. 

    
 Only place for wands, is Ollivanders. You go inside. I got one
    more thing I gotta' do. 

   
 I wondered when I'd be seeing you, Mr. Potter. Seems only yesterday your
    mother and father were in here buying their first wands ... 
 Here we are. Just give it a wave.
     
 No. Apparently not. Perhaps
    this. 

   
 No. No. Definitely not. No Matter. After all ... it's the wand that
    chooses the wizard. 
 I wonder... 
 Go on then. 
 Curious. Very curious. 
 Sorry, but what's curious? 
 I remember every wand I've ever sold, Mr. Potter. It so happens that the
    phoenix whose tail feather resides in your wand, gave another feather. Just one other. It's
    curious that you should be destined for this wand when its brother 
 gave you that scar. 
 And who owned that wand? 

   
 We don't speak his name, Harry. 
 As I said, the wand chooses the wizard, Mr. Potter. It's not always clear
    why. But I think it's clear we can expect great things from you. After all,
    He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things. 
 Terrible, yes. But great. 

   
 Happy Birthday, Harry. 

    
 For me? Really? He's Mine? 
 Crikey, yeh'd think yeh hadn't gotten. a birthday present before. 
 I haven't. Not really. 
 You all right, Harry? Yer very quiet. 

    
 He killed my parents, didn't he? The one who gave me this.
    You know, Hagrid. I know you do. 

   
 'Course I know. Who do yeh think carried yeh out o' yer parents' house,
    Hallowe'en night, ten years ago? Who do yeh think brought yeh ter Dumbledore an' watched him lay
    yeh on yer Aunt an' Uncle's doorstep? 'Course I know, Harry. 
 Firs', un'erstand this, 'cause it's important: not all
    yer wizards are good. Some go bad. Years ago, there was this one wizard who weent as bad as you
    could go. His name was... was... 
 Maybe if you wrote it down. 
 Nah--can' spell it. All right-- Voldemort. 
 Voldemort? 
 Dark days those were, Harry. Volde... You-Know-Who... started lookin' fer
    followers. Got 'em too. Anyone that stood up to him ended up dead. Including yer parents. No one
    lived once he decided to kill 'em. Not one. 'Cept you. 
 Me? Voldemort tried to kill me? 
 That's no ord'nary cut on your forehead. A mark like that only comes when
    yeh've been touched by a curse. An evil curse. 
 But what happened to Vol... to You-Know-Who? 
 Some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. I reckon he's out there
    somewhere, jus' too weak to carry on. But one thing's fer certain, Harry. Somethin' about you
    stumped him that night. That's why you're famous. That's why e'ryone knows yer name.
     
 You
    're the boy who lived. 
 Blimey, look at the time. 'Fraid I 'ave ter be leavin' yeh now, Harry.
    Dumbledore will be wantin' 
 He'll
    be wantin' 'ter see me. 
 That there's yer train. Leaves in
    about ten minutes time. Jus' make sure yeh stick ter yeh ticket. That's very important, Harry.
    Stick ter yeh ticket... 
 There must be something wrong, Hagrid. This says Platform Nine and Three
    Quarters. There's no such thing.
    
 ...Is there?  
 Excuse me. Can you tell me where I might find Platform Nine and
    Three-Quarters. 

    
 Think you're funny, do you? Nine and Three-Quarters indeed...
    Harry looks about, despairingly, then HEARS... 

    
 ...packed with Muggles, of course. 
 All right, Percy. You first.
     
 Fred. You next. 
 I'm not Fred I'm George. Honestly, woman, you call yourself our mother? 
 Sorry, George. 
 Only joking. I am Fred. 
 Excuse me. Could you tell me-- 
 How to get onto the platform? Not to worry, dear. It's Ron's first time
    to Hogwarts as well. 
 All you have to do is walk straight at the barrier
    between Platforms Nine and Ten. Focus ... but don't stop and don't be scared you'll crash into
    it either. Best do it at a bit of a run if you're nervous. 
 Gran! I've lost my toad again. 
 Oh, Neville. Honestly. Not again... 
 Go on, Lee. Give us a look. 
 Want a hand? 
 Yes, please. 
 Oy! C'mere, Fred! Take a handle. 
 Thanks very much. 
 Blimey. You're... 
 Harry Potter. 
 What'? Oh, him. Yes. I mean, I am. 
 Fred! George! Come say goodbye to Ginny. Mrs. Weasley stands waving,
    the redheaded girl clinging to her dress. The twins take one last look at Harry, dash off. 
 Have to go, Mother. The other Prefects are expecting me up front. 
 Mum! Guess who's on the train? Right now... 
 Harry Potter! 
 Oh, Mum, can I go on and see him? Please. 
 Certainly not. The boy isn't something you goggle at in a zoo.
     
 All right, on you go, all of what is that on your nose?
     
 You two watch out for your brother. And behave yourselves this year. If I get
    one more owl teeling me you've blown up a toilet or something-- 
 Blown up a toilet? We've never blown up a toilet. 
 Great idea, though, thanks, Mum! 
 Mind? Everywhere else is full. 
 Not at all. 
 I'm Ron, by the way. 
 I heard. I'm Harry. 
 I... heard. 
 Is it true? I mean, have you
    really got the... you know... 
 Wicked. 
 Are all your family wizards? 
 Huh? Oh. I think so. Well, Mum's got a second cousin who's an accountant. But we
    never talk about him. I heard you went to live with Mugg1es. What are they like? 
 Horrible. Well, not all of them. Mine are, though. Trade them for three wizard
    brothers any day. 
 Five. I'm the sixth in our family to go to Hogwarts. Everyone expects me to do
    as well as the others. But if I do, it's no big deal because they did it first. You never get
    anything new, either, with five brothers. I've got Bill's old robes. Charlie's old wand. Even
    Scabbers used to be Percy's... 
 Hardly ever wakes up. He's useless basically.
    Percy got an owl for making Prefect, but Mum and Dad couldn't afford-- I mean, I got Scabbers
    instead. 
 Anything off the trolley, dears? 
 We'll take the lot. 
 'Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans'? 
 They mean every flavor. There's chocolate, peppermint... but you can also get
    liver or spinach or tripe. George reckons he had a bogey-flavored one once. 
 These aren't real 'frogs, are they? 

    
 Just a spell. Besides, it's the card you want. Each pack's got a
    Famous Witch or Wizard. Got about 500 myself. Watch it! 
 That's rotten luck.
    They've only got one good jump in them to begin with. 

   
 I've gotten Dumbledore! 
 I've about six of him. Trade you Scabbers though, if you get Agrippa or Ptolemy. 

    
 Considered by many the greatest wizard of modern times,
    Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for his
    discovery of the 12 uses of dragon's blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas
    Flamel. Approximately one hundred and fifty years old, Professor Dumbledore enjoys chamber
    music, tenpin bowling, and...' 
 One hundred arid fifty years old? 
 Thought he'd be older, did you? 
 No-- I--Hey, he's gone. 
 Well, you can't expect him to hang around all day, can you? 
 It's just, in the Muggle world, people stay put in photos. 
 Really? They don't move at all? Weird! 
 Pathetic, isn't it? Fred gave me a spell that's to turn him yellow. Want
    to see? 
 Has anyone seen a toad? A boy named Neville has lost one. 
 Oh, are you doing magic? Let's see then. 
 Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow, Turn this stupid. fat rat yellow. 
 Are you sure that's a real spell? Well, it's not very good, is it? I've
    only tried a few simple ones myself but they've all worked for me. For example ... 
 Goodness. You're Harry Potter, aren't you? I know all about you, of course. I
    was doing a little recreational reading and you're in Modern Magical History, The Rise and Fall
    of the Dark Arts and Great Wizarding Events of the 20th Century. 
 Am I? 
 Didn't you know? I'd have found out everything I could if it was me.
     
 Anyway ... Oculus Reparo. 
 There. That's better, isn't it? I'm Hermione
    Granger, by the way. And you are ... ? · 

   
 Um... Ron Weasley. 
 Pleasure. Do either of you know what House you'll be in? I'm hoping for
    Gryffindor--I hear Dumbledore himself was in it--but I think I might just die if they put me in
    Slytherin. That was You-Know- Who' s House. Anyway, you two had better change into your robes. I
    expect we'll be arriving soon. You've got dirt on your nose, by the way, did you know? 
 Firs' years! Firs' years over here!
 You there! Don' be trailin' yer fingers in the water. Yeh might find yeh don'
    get 'em all back. 
 Welcome to Hogwarts. In a moment, you will pass through these doors and
    join your classmates, but before you can take your seats,you must be sorted into your Houses.
    They are Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. While here, your House is, in many
    ways, your family. Your triumphs will earn your House points, while any rule-breaking will lose
    points. At the end of the year, the House with the most is awarded the House Cup, a great honor.
    I hope each of you...
 Trevor! 
 ...will be a credit to whichever House becomes yours. The Sorting Ceremony
    will begin momentarily. 
 How exactly do they sort us? 
 Some kind of test, I think. Fred says it hurts like hell, but I'm sure he was
    joking. At least... I think he was. 
 It's true then, what they were saying on the train. Harry Potter has come to
    Hogwarts. 
 Oh. This is Crabbe
    and Goyle. And my name's Malfoy. Draco Malfoy. 
 Think my name's funny, do you? No need to ask yours. Red hair, freckles,
    and a hand- me-down robe--you must be a Weasley. 
 You'll soon find out
    some wizarding families are better than others, Potter. You don't want to go making friends with
    the wrong sort. I can help you there. 
 I think I can tell the wrong sort for myself, thanks. 
 Well, he's rather disagreeable, isn't he? 
 We are ready for you. 
 It' s not real, the ceiling. It's only bewitched to look like the night
    sky. I read about it in Hogwarts, A History. 
 Before we begin, Professor Dumbledore would like to say a few words.
     
 Yes, and here they are: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak! Thank you!
     
 I hear he's a genius. 
 Oh, you may not think I'm pretty But don't judge on what you see I'll
    eat myself if you can find A smarter hat than me. There' s nothing hidden in your head The
    Sorting Hat can't see So try me on and I will tell you Where you ought to be.... 
 When I call your name, you will come forth, put on the hat and be sorted.
     
 Hermione Granger. 
 Oh dear. Here it is, isn't it? The moment. Goodness. What if the hat says
    nothing and we're all just left standing here forever ... 

    
 Mental, that one. I'm telling you. 
 GRYFFINDOR! 
 Draco Malfoy. 
 Slytherin. 
 SLYTHERIN! 

    
 There's not a witch or wizard who went bad who wasn't in
    Slytherin. Draco's father was one of the first to join You-Know-Who when he got power. And one
    of the first to come back when he lost it. 
 Susan Bones. 
 Ouch! 
 Harry? What is it? 
 N-nothing. I'm fine. 
 Hufflepuff! 
 Ronald Weasley. 
 Gryffindor! 
 Harry Potter. 
 If you will, Mr.
    Potter. 
 Hmmm. Difficult. Very Difficult. Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad
    mind either. There's talent, oh yes, and a thirst to prove yourself. But where to put you...?
     
 Not Slytherin, eh? Are you sure? You could be great, you
    know, it's all here in your head, and Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness, no doubt
    about that... No? Well, if you're sure... better be GRYFFINDOR! 
 I'm half and half. Me dad's a Muggle, Mam's a witch. Bit of a nasty shock for
    him when he found out. 
 Say, Percy. Who's that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell? 
 Hm? Oh. Professor Snape. Head of Slytherin House 
 What's he teach? 
 Potions. But everyone knows it's the Dark Arts he fancies. Been after
    Quirrell's job for years. 
 Hello, Sir Nicolas. Have a nice summer? 
 Dismal. What with the Slytherins winning the House Cup six
    years in a row, the Bloody Baron's become unbearable. 
 Then
    again, he's always been unbearable. 
 I know you. You're Nearly Headless Nick. 
 I prefer Sir Nicolas, if you don't mind. 
 Nearly headless? How can you be nearly headless? 
 Like this. 

    
 I think I'm done eating. 
 If I may, I have a few start-of-term notices to announce. First Years
    should note that the Dark Forest is strictly forbidden to all pupils. Also, our caretaker, Mr.
    Filch has asked me to remind you that... 
 ... no magic
    should be used between classes in the corridors. And finally, please note that this year, the
    third floor corridor on the right hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to
    die a most painful death. 
 And now, let us sing the school song! Everyone
    pick their favorite tune and off we go! 

   
 
 Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts Teach us things worth
    knowing Bring back what we've forgot Just do your best, we'll do the rest And learn until our
    brains all rot ... 
 This is the most direct path to the dormitory, except on Fridays, of course,
    when the staircases change. 

   
 Gryffindors, I givee you Peeves, Hogwarts resident poltergeist
 Oooh! Ickle Firsties ! What fun! 

    
 Rather a nuisance, I'm afraid. Ah. Here we are. 
 Password? 
 Caput Draconis. 
 Girls' dormitory to the left. Boys to the right. You'll find your belongings
    have already been brought up. Any questions? 
 Then, goodnight
    all. Oh, and don' t forget. Before retiring, please place all living potion ingredients in your
    cupboards. This includes slugs, fire beetles and cutworms. Sweet dreams... 
 This is Staircase Twelve North, which should take us to Backward Staircase
    Seven--no wait a minute, we're on Backward Staircase Seven... 
 How many staircases are there? 
 One hundred forty-two, though, in A History of Magic, Bathilda Bagshot
    makes unattributed reference to three others. 
 I hate her. 
 Whew! We made it, mate. Can you imagine old McGonagall's face if we were late
    first day out... 
 That was bloody
    brilliant! 
 Thank you for that assessment, Mr. Weasley. But perhaps it might be more
    useful if I transfigured Mr. Potter or yourself into a pocket watch. That way one of you might
    be on time. 
 We got lost. 
 Then perhaps a map. I trust you don't need one to find your seats?
     
 Transfiguration is
    some of the most complex, dangerous and valuable magic you will learn at Hogwarts. Use it
    skillfully and it may, one day, save your life. Make a mistake and you could find yourself with
    a toad's head and a monkey's tail. 
 All right then .. Shall
    we? 
 There will be no foolish wand waving or silly incantations in this class. As
    such, I don't expect many of you to appreciate the subtle science and exact art that is potion
    making. However, for those select few... 
 ... who possess the
    predisposition, I can teach you how to bewitch the mind and ensnare the senses. I can tell you
    how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death. Then again, maybe some of you have come to
    Hogwarts in possession of abilities so formidable that you feel confident enough to... not pay
    attention. 
 Mr. Potter. Our
    new... celebrity. Tell me. What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion
    of wormwood? 
 You
    don't know. Well, let's try again. Where, Mr. Potter, would you look if I told you to find me a
    bezoar? 
 I don't know, sir. 
 And the difference between monkshood and wolfsbane? 
 I don't know, sir. 
 Pity. Clearly fame isn't everything, is it, Mr. Potter. 
 Clearly Hermione knows. It seems a pity not to ask her. 
 Silence! And put your hand down, you silly girl! 
 For your information, Potter, asphodel and
    wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is know as the Draught of the Living Dead. A
    bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons. As
    for monkshood and wolfbane, they are the same plant, which also goes by the name of ... aconite.
     
 Well, why aren't you all copying this down? 
 And Gryffindors. Note,that five points will be
    taken from your House for your classmate's cheek. 
 Eye of rabbit, harp string hum... 
 What's Seamus trying to do to that glass of water? 
 Turn it to rum. Actually managed a weak tea yesterday before it...
     
 Two Knuts says he loses his
    eyebrows by week's end. Ah, mail's here. 
 Hey look! Neville's gotten a Remembrall! 

   
 I've read about those. If the smoke turns red it means you've forgotten
    something. 
 Only problem is... I can't remember what I've forgotten. 
 Hey, Ron. Somebody broke into Gringotts! Listen: 'Believed to be the work of
    Dark wizards or witches unknown, Gringotts goblins, while acknowleging the breach, insist
    nothing was taken. The vault in question had, in fact, been emptied earlier that very same day.'
    That's odd. 
 It's mad. Dad says there are dragons guarding some of the vaults. 
 No. It's just odd... That's the day Hagrid and I were there. 
 Welcome to your first Flying Lesson. Well, what are you all waiting
    for? Everyone step up to a broomstick. Come now. Hurry up. 
 Stick out your
    right hand, over the broom, and say "Up"! 
 Now. Once you've got hold
    of the broom, I want you to mount it. And grip it tight. We don't want you sliding off the end.
     
 Your other right hand, Mr. Finnegan. Goodness, boy, what have
    you done with your eyebrows? 
 Lost 'em, ma'am. 
 Excuse me, Madam Hooch. Given that a few of us have been on sticks for years,
    would it not make sense to separate the expert flyers from... 

    the neophytes? 
 Thank you, Mr. Malfoy, but I'm sure even an expert flyer such as
    yourself can appreciate the benefits of reacquainting oneself with the basics. Your grip, for
    example. It's thumb in, not out. 

    Very well. Now when I blow my whistle, I want each of you to kick off from the ground. Hard.
    Keep your brooms steady, hover for a moment, then lean forward slightly and touch back down. On
    my whistle...Three ... Two ... 
 Mr. Longbottom! Exactly where
    do you think you're going? 
 Come down here this instant! 
 On your broomstick, Longbottom! 

    Broken wrist. Corne on, dear. Up you get. 
 Everyone's to keep
    their feet on the ground while I take Mr. Longbottom to the Hospital Wing. Understand? If I see
    a single broom in the air, the one riding it will find themselves out of Hogwarts before they
    can say 'Quidditch.' 

   
 Did you see his face? Perhaps if the great lump had given this a squeeze, he
    would've remembered to fall on his fat arse. 
 Give it here, Malfoy. 
 No, I think I'll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find. How about up a
    tree? 
 What's the matter,
    Potter? A bit beyond your reach? 

   
 Harry! No! You heard what Madame Hooch said. Besides you don't even know
    how to fly. 
 Give it here. Or I'll knock you off that ruddy broom. 
 Is that so? 
 Have it your way, then! 

   
 HAR-RY POT-TER! 
 Chin up, Potter. They might let you stay on as Hagrid's assistant. 
 Excuse me, Professor Quirrell, could I borrow Wood for a moment.
     
 Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood... I've found you a
    Seeker. 
 Seeker! But first years never make the House teams. You must be the youngest
    Quidditch player in- 
 --a century. According to McGonagall. Just then, Fred and George descend. 
 Well done, Harry. Wood's just told us. 
 Fred and George are on the team too. Beaters. 
 Our job to make sure you don't get bloodied up too bad. Can't make any
    promises, of course. Rough game, Quidditch. 
 Brutal. But no one's died in years Someone will vanish occasionally... 
 But they turn up in a month or two. 
 Oh go on, Harry. Quidditch is great. Best game there is. And you'll be great too. 
 I've never even played Quidditch. What if I make a fool of myself? 
 You won't make a fool of yourself. 
 It's in your blood. 
 Harry ... you didn't tell me your father was a Seeker too. 
 I... didn't know. 
 I'm telling you, it's spooky. She knows more about you than you do. 
 Who doesn't? 
 Does anybody feel like ... we shouldn't be here? 
 We're not supposed to be here. This is the Third Floor. It's forbidden. 

    
 Why, though? 
 Because Dumbledore said so. Let's go. 
 Who goes there! 
 Lead me to them, my sweet.... 
 That's it. We' re done for. 
 Oh, move over. Alohomora! 
 Standard Book of Spells. Chapter
    Seven. 
 Chapter Seven? 
 Shhh! Filch is... gone. 
 He probably thinks this door is locked. 
 It was locked. 
 And for good reason... 

   
 What do they think they're doing keeping a thing like that locked up in school? 
 You don't use your eyes, do you? Didn't you see what it was standing on? 
 I wasn't looking at its feet. I was a bit preoccupied with its heads. Or maybe
    you didn't notice. There were three. 
 It was standing on a trapdoor, which means it's not there by accident. It's- 
 Guarding something. 
 That's right. Now, if you don't mind, I think I'll go to bed before either
    of you figures out another clever way to get us killed. Or worse... expelled. 
 Quidditch is easy enough to understand. Each team has seven players: Three
    Chasers, two Beaters, one Keeper and the Seeker--that' s you. There are three kinds of balls.
    This one's called the Quaffle. 
 The Chasers handle the
    Quaffle and try to put it through one of three hoops. The Keeper--that's me--defends the hoops.
    With me so far? 
 I think so. What's in there? 
 Here. Take this. 
 Not bad, Potter. You'd make a fair Beater.
    Careful now, it's coming back. 

   
 What was that? 
 Bludger. Nasty little buggers. But you're a Seeker. The only ball I want you to
    worry about is... this. 
 I like this ball. 
 You,like it now. Just wait. It's wicked fast and damn near impossible to see. 
 What do I do with it? 
 Catch it. Before the other team's Seeker. You catch this, the game is over. You
    catch this, Potter... we win. 
 Now don't forget that nice wrist movement we've been practising.
    Swish and flick. Swish and flick. 
 Wingardium Leviosa. 
 And enunciate! Never forget Wizard Bartiffio, who said 's' instead
    of 'f' and found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his chest. 
 WINGARDIUM LEVIOSA! 
 Honestly. You're going to take someone's eye out. Besides, you're saying it
    wrong. It's Levi-ohhhh-sa. Not· Levi-o-saaaah. 
 You do it then, if you're so clever. 
 Wingardium Leviosa. 
 Oh, well done! Everyone see here. Miss Granger's done it! 
 I think we're going to need another feather over here, Professor. 
 It's Levi-ohhhhh-sa. Not Levi-o-saaaah. She's a nightmare, honestly. No wonder
    she hasn't got any friends. 
 I think she heard you. 
 How are you, Potter? All right? 
 Yes, Professor. Fine. 
 I know ... that is, we know... the members of the staff... that this is
    perhaps a difficult night for you. Halloween. Your parents...
 I'm all right, Professor. 
 Very well. 
 Professor... Thank you. 
 You're welcome, Potter. 
 Parvati Patil said she wouldn't come out of the girls' bathroom. Said she's
    been in there all afternoon. Crying. 
 TROLL IN THE DUNGEON! TROLL IN THE DUNGEON!Thought you ought to
     know...
 Everyone will please not panic. Prefects, lead your Houses back to the
    dormitories. Teachers, follow me to the dungeons. 
 How could a troll get in? 
 Not on its own. Trolls are really stupid. Probably Peeves' playing jokes...
     
 What? 
 Hermione. She doesn't know. 
 That's the third floor he's going to. Teachers were supposed to go to the
    dungeons... 
 What's that? 
 Smells like Fred's socks. Only... worse. 
 Follow me.
 Yes! 
 This wouldn't be the girl's bathroom, would it?
 Don't worry, Hermione! We're here! 
 She's
    dead. 
 I heard that! 
 What do we do? 

    
 Confuse it! 
 Confuse it? 
 Hey, pea brain! 

    Wingardium Leviosa. 
 Wingardium LEVI-OHHHH-SA! 
 Is it--dead? 
 I don't think so. Just knocked out. 
 No need to kill it, after all. 
 Yes, well, that was big of you. Ugh. Troll snot. 
 Explain yourselves! Both of you. 
 It's my fault, Professor McGonagall. 
 Miss Granger! 
 I went looking for the troll. I've read about them and thought I could
    handle it. But I was wrong. If Harry and Ron hadn't come along ... I'd be dead. 
 I'm very disappointed in you, Miss Granger. Five points will be taken
    from Gryffindor for your very serious lack of judgement. As for you gentlemen, I hope you
    realize just how lucky you are. Not many First Years could take on a full grown mountain troll
    and live to tell the tale. I award each of you five points... for sheer dumb luck. 
 Good of her to get us out of trouble like that. 
 Mind you, we did save her from a full grown mountain troll. 
 Mind you, she might not have needed saving if we hadn't locked the thing in
    with her. 
 What are friends for? 
 Take a bit of toast, mate. Go on. 
 Ron's right, Harry. You're going to need your strength today. 
 I'm not hungry. 

    
 Good luck today, Potter. Then again, now that you've proven yourself
    against a troll, a little game of Quidditch should be easy work for you. Even if it is against
    my boys. 
 That was ... disturbing. 
 I tell you what's disturbing. Snape smiling. 
 That explains the blood. 
 Blood? 
 Last night, Ron and I saw Snape heading for the third floor. I'm guessing he
    let the troll in as a diversion, tried to get past the three-headed dog, and got himself bit.
    That's why he's limping._ 
 But why would anyone go near that dog? 
 Listen. The day I was at Gringotts, Hagrid took something out of one of the
    vaults. Said it was Hogwarts business. Very secret. 
 So you're saying... 
 That's what the dog's guarding. That's what Snape wants. 
 But what's safer than Gringotts? 
 One place, according to Hagrid. Hogwarts. 
 Well, whatever it is, it must be really valuable. 
 Or really dangerous. 
 Bit early for mail, isn't it? 
 That's Hedwig. 
 It's a broomstick. 
 That's not a broomstick, Harry. That's a Nimbus Two Thousand. 
 But who...?
 I know what you'ree thinking, Harry. I'm playing my first game of Quidditch,
    the entire school's watching me and, worst of all, it's against Slytherin. Am I right? 
 Pretty close. 
 It' s all right. I felt the same way before my first game. 
 What happened? 
 I don't really remember. I took a Bludger to the head about two minutes in and
    woke up in the hospital week later. 
 Now, I want a nice clean game. From all of you. 
 Who's he, Angelina? 
 Marcus Flint. Slytherin Captain. They say he's got troll blood in him.
     
 Mount your brooms, please. 
 Quaffle's up... and straight off taken by Angelina Johnson of Gryffindor.
    What an excellent Chaser that girl is, and rather attractive too, I might add... 
 Budge up there. Clear the way.How's Harry holdin' up? 
 He hasn't had much to do yet. 
 First game. He stays outta trouble, that'll be doin' enough. 
 The Snitch!
 FOUL! FOUL! FOUL! 
 Dunno what Harry thinks he's doin'. If I didn't know better, I'd say he's
     lost control of his broom... 
 Maybe something happened to it when Flint blocked him. 
 No. Can't nothin' interfere with a broomstick except powerful Dark magic. No
     kid could do that to a Nimbus 2000. 

     
 It's Snape. He's jinxing the broom. 
 Jinxing the broom? What do we do? 
 Leave it to me. As Hermione dashes off, Ron turns the binoculars back to
     the sky. Harry hangs from the broom with two hands while Fred hovers nearby. George circles
     about ten feet below. 
 What's George doing? 
 Just in case you fall, George will... 
 ... catch you. 
 I knew I should have gone out for football. 
 What's football? 
 Take a good look, lads. With any luck we'll be having Potter soup for supper.
      
 Come on, Hermione...
 Well, that's unfortunate. Understandable, but unfortunate. 
 Unfortunate nothin'. He's got the Snitch! 
 He didn't catch it. He swallowed it!. 

     
 Nothing in the Quidditch rulebook discriminates against catching
     the Snitch in your mouth. Or any other place for that matter. In fact, in a game played in
     Greece in the late seventeenth century- 
 Thank you, Miss Granger. We can dispense with the more unattractive
     historical details of the game. Nevertheless, your point is well taken. Match to Gryffindor!
      

    
 Rubbish! Why would Snape put a curse on Harry's broom? 
 Who knows? Why was he trying to get past that three-headed dog on Halloween? 
 How do you know about Fluffy? 
 Fluffy? 
 That thing has a name? 
 'Course he's got a name. He's mine. Bought him off an Irish bloke I met in the
    Pub las' year. Lent him to Dumbledore to guard the... 
 Yes? 
 Don' be askin' me anymore. That's top secret, that is. 
 But Hagrid, whatever Fluffy's guarding, Snape's trying to steal it. 
 Codswallop! Snape's a Hogwart'steacher. 
 Hogwarts teacher or not, I know a jinx when I see one, Hagrid. I've read
    all about them. You've got to keep eye contact, and Snape wasn't blinking. 
 Now listen to me, all three of yeh-- yer meddlin' in things that shouldn't be
    meddled. It's dangerous. What that dog's guardin' is strictly betw'n Professor Dumbledore and
    Nicolas Flamel--
 Nicolas Flamel. Why does that name sound familiar? 
 Listen up! As the lake is frozen, all students going home for holiday
    will take a flying sleigh to the departure platform. Earmuffs are strongly recommended. 
 Don't send me there! Can't you see his Knight? Send him. We can afford to
    lose him. 
 Queen to pawn six. 
 Oh my god! That' s barbaric ! 
 That's chess. I see you're packed. 
 I see you're not. 
 Change of plans. My parents decided to go to Romania to visit my brother
    Charlie. He's studying dragons there. 
 You can help Harry then. He promised to keep looking in the library for
    Nicolas Flamel over holiday. 
 We have looked. A hundred times. 

    
 Not in the Restricted Section. 
 Happy Christmas, Harry! 
 I've got presents. 
 What'd you expect? In your hand's from Hagrid. And by the looks of that lumpy
    one, Mum's sent you a Weasley sweater. 
 Your father left this in my possession before he died. It is time it was
    returned to you. 
 It's some kind of... cloak. 
 Well let's see then. Put it on. 
 Ahhh! 
 Harry, do you know what this is? It's an invisibility cloak. They're really rare.
    Who gave you this? 
 ...There's no name ... It just says, 'Use it well.' 
 Flamel. Nicolas Flamel...
 Have you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid's, yet? 
 B-b-but Severus, I- 
 You don't want me as your enemy, Quirrel. 
 I don't know what you- 
 You know perfectly well what I mean. Your little bit of hocus pocus...
     
 We'll have another little
    chat soon, when you've had time to think things over and decide where your loyalties lie.
     
 Professors... I found this. In the Restricted Section. It's still hot. 
 Then they can't be far. 
 Ah! 
 Mum? Dad? 
 Ron! Ron! Wake up! 
 There's something you've got to see! 
 Come look! It's my family. 

    
 That's you, Harry. 
 Look in properly, go on, stand here. 
 There. You see them, don't you? That's- 
 Me. Only I'm... Head Boy! And I'm holding the Quidditch Cup and... bloody
    hell... I'm Quidditch Captain too! Harry, do you think this mirror shows the future? 

    
 How can it? All my family are dead. 
 Want to play chess? 
 No. 
 Want to go visit Hagrid? 
 No. 
 Harry, I know what you're thinking. But don't. There's something not right about
    that mirror. 

     
 Back again, Harry? 
 I see that you--like so many before you--have discovered the delights of
     the Mirror of Erised. I expect by now you realize what it does. 
 It shows me my family. 
 And it showed your friend Ron himself as Head Boy. 
 I don't need a cloak to become invisible. 
 I'll give you a clue, Harry. The happiest man on earth would look into the
    Mirror of Erised and see only himself, exactly. as he is. 
 So, then, it shows us what we want... Whatever we want... 
 Yes and no. It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most
    desperate desire of our hearts. You, who have never known your family, see them gathered around
    you. Ronald Weasley, who has always been overshadowed by his family, sees himself standing
    alone. Remember this, though, Harry. This mirror gives us neither knowledge or truth. Men have
    wasted away before it. Even gone mad. 
 That's why it will be moved to a
    new home tomorrow. I ask that you do not go looking for it again, Harry. It does not do to dwell
    on dreams and forget to live. 
 Can I ask you something, Professor? What do you see when you look in the
    Mirror? 
 I? I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks. One can never have
    enough socks, Harry. You'll do well to remember that as well. 
 I'll ask you again. What are the three most crucial ingredients in a
    Forgetfulness Potion? 
 And I'll tell you again. I forgot. 
 And what, may I ask, do you plan to do should you get that question on
    final exams? 
 Crib off you. 
 You will not. Besides, according to Professor McGonagall, we're to be given
    special quills bewitched with an anti-cheating spell. 
 That's insulting. It's as if they don't trust us. 

    Dumbledore again. 
 Leg-Locker Curse. 
 Malfoy.
     
 You've got to start standing up to him, Neville. 
 How? I can't stand up at all. 
 I offered to do the countercurse, but he wouldn't let me. 
 Of course not. That's all I need, you to set my bloody kneecaps on fire. 
 I don't appreciate the insinuation, Longbottom. Besides, if anyone cares to
    notice, my eyebrows have completely grown back. 
 All right then, Neville, who shall it be? Me, Hermione, or... 
 I've found him. 
 He's bowling. So what? He's always bowling. 
 Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the
    dark wizard Grindelwald, for the discovery ofthe twelve uses of dragon's blood... and his work
    on alchemy... with his partner, Nicolas Flamel. 
 I knew the name sounded familiar. I read it on the train that day.
 Follow me. 
 Hey! Wait! What about that counter-curse! Neville's eyes shift. Seamus
    smiles, raises an eyebrow. 
 How could I be so stupid! I checked this out weeks ago for a bit of light
    reading. 
 This is light? 
 Of course! Here it is! 
 Nicolas
    Flamel is the only known maker of the Sorcerer's Stone! 
 The what? 
 Oh, honestly, don't you two read? 
 The sorcerer's
    Stone is a legendary substance with astonishing powers. It will transform any metal in to pure
    gold, and produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal. 
 Immortal. 
 It means you'll never die. 
 I know what it means-- 
 The only stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicolas Flamel, the
    noted alchemist, who last year celebrated his six hundred and sixty-fifth birthday.
     
 That's what Fluffy's guarding on the Third Floor. That's what's
    under the trapdoor. The Sorcerer's Stone! 
 So Flamel knows someone's after the Stone... gives it to Dumbledore to keep
    safe at Hogwarts ... not realizing that the one who's after it .. . 
 Teaches at Hogwarts. 
 So Snape wants piles of gold and to live forever. Who wouldn't? 
 What is it, Hermione? 
 I don't want to scare you, Harry. It's just ... if all Snape wants is the
    Sorcerer's Stone ... why did he try to kill you that day on the Quidditch pitch? 
 Oh. Hullo. Er... not ter be rude, but I'm not really fit ter entertain right
    about- 
 We know about the Sorcerer's Stone. 
 Snape! Blimey, yer not still on abou' him, are yeh? 
 Hagrid, we know he's after the Stone. We just don't know... why. 
 Harry, Snape was one o' the teachers in on protectin' the Stone. He's not
    abou' ter steal it. 
 What? 
 Yeh heard me: Snape was one o' the teachers in on protectin' the Stone. Now,
    as I said, I'm a bit preoccupied at moment-- 
 Wait a minute. One of the teachers? 
 Of course! There are other things defending the Stone, aren't there?
    Spells, enchantments... 
 Tha' right. Bloody waste o' time if yeh ask me. T'ain't no one goin' ter get
    past Fluffy. Not a soul knows how 'cept me an' Dumbledore--
 Hagrid... exactly what is that? 
 Ah. Well. That's ... er ... 
 I know what that is! But Hagrid. How did you ever get one? 
 Won it. Off a stranger in the village. Think he was glad ter be rid of it,
    ter be honest. Blimey...
 Is that... a dragon? 
 That's not just a dragon! That's a Norwegian Ridgeback! My brother Charlie works
    with these in Romania 
 Isn't he' beautiful! Bless 'im, look, he knows 'is Mummy! 
 Hullo, Norbert. 
 Norbert? 
 Well, he's got ter have a name. 
 Needs ter be trained up a bit, o' course.
     
 Hey, you there! 

   
 Malfoy! 
 Hagrid always wanted a dragon. Told me so the first time I ever met him. 
 But it's crazy. And worse, Malfoy knows. 
 I don't Understand. Is that bad?

     
 Mr. Potter. Mr. Weasley. Miss Granger. 

    
 It's bad. 
 As every schoolchild knows, dragon- breeding is against our laws, has
    been ever since the Warlock's Convention of 1709. And for good reason. It's hard to keep the
    Muggles from noticing us if we've got a thirty-foot Ukranian Ironbelly running around the back
    garden. 
 Norwegian Ridgeback. 
 I just meant... in this case... sorry. 
 Personally, I don't care if Hagrid has a Chinese Fireball sitting in his
    kitchen, Mr. Weasley. He answers to Dumbledore. You, on the other hand, answer to me. Nothing--I
    repeat, nothing--gives a student the right to walk about the school at night. Therefore, as
    punishment for your actions, fifty points will be taken. 
 Fifty? 
 Each. And to insure it doesn't happen again, all four of you
    will receive detention. 
 Excuse me, Professor. Perhaps I heard you wrong. I thought you said the four
    of us. 
 Indeed. You see, Mr. Malfoy, noble your intentions, you too were out of
    bed after hours. You will classmates in detention. 
 Don't worry, you three. This'll all blow over. 
 It may take a year or two, but eventually people will start talking to you
    again. 

    
 Well, I for one, see nothing wrong with a reduced social
    life. It'll give us more time to revise for finals. 
 Why bother? Even with Malfoy losing points, Slytherin's a lock for the House
    Cup. And look. Malfoy knows it. 
 He won't be smiling tonight. 

    Haven't you heard? For detention they're taking us into the Dark Forest. 
 A pity they let the old punishments die. Was a time, detention would find you
    all hanging by your thumbs in the dungeons... 
 A sorry lot this, Hagrid. I pity you. 
 Good god, man, you're not still on about that bloody dragon, are
    you? 

    
 Norbert's gone. Dumbledore's sent him off ter Romania
    ter live in a colony. 
 Well, that's good, isn't it? He'll be with his own kind. Better all around,
    don't you think? Especially for Fang. 
 But what if Norbert doesn't like Romania. What if the other dragons are mean
    to him? He's only a baby, after all. 
 A baby that breaths fire. 
 For god's sake, pull yourself together, man. You're going into the Forest,
    after all. Got to have your wits about you. 
 The Forest? But I thought that was just a joke. We can't go in the Forest.
    Students aren't allowed. And there's... werewolves. 

    
 Oh, there's more'n werewolves in those trees, lad. You can be
    sure o' that. 
 Sorry abou' this, Harry. Know it's me that deserves punishin', not you. By all
    rights I should be sittin' in a cell in Azkaban tonight. 
 It's all right Hagrid. Besides, it's not your fault we were out after hours. If
    we hadn't come knocking on your door in the middle of the night-- 
 What's that? 
 The reason we're here. 
 All righ' now, lis'en up. See
    this here? 
 It's unicorn
    blood. I found one dead a few weeks back and two before that first term. This one here's been
    hurt bad by summat. It's our job to find the poor thing. Only one way ter get that done and
    that's ter split inter two parties. Ron, Hermione--yeh'll come with me. Harry, yeh'll go with
    Malfoy. 
 I want Fang then. 
 Fine. But jus' so yeh know. He's a bloody coward. 
 Wait until my father hears about this. This is servant stuff. We should be
    writing lines or... something. 
 If I didn't know better, Draco, I'd say you were scared. 
 You're too stupid to be scared, Potter, growing up with Muggles. If you were
    from a real wizard family, you wouldn't be laughing. 
 I'm not, believe me...
 AAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
 Harry Potter. You are known to many creatures here. You must leave. The
    forest is not safe at this time. Especially for you. 
 What was that thing you saved me from? 
 Only one who has nothing to lose would commit such a crime. It is a
    monstrous thing to slay a unicorn. The blood of a unicorn will keep you alive, even if you are
    an inch from death, but at a terrible price. You have slain something so pure that--from the
    moment the blood touches your lips--you will have a half life. A cursed life. 
 But who would choose such a life? 
 Can you think of no one? 
 Do you mean to say that thing that killed the unicorn, that was drinking its
    blood, that was Voldemort! 
 Do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment, Harry Potter? 
 The Sorcerer's Stone. 
 The
    Philosopher's Stone.
 Harry! 
 Oh, it's you, is it, Firenze. I see you've met our Mr. Potter. All right
    there, Harry?
 You mean... You-Know-Who's out there, right now, in the forest! 
 But he's weak. He's living off the unicorns. Don't you see? We had it wrong.
    Snape doesn't want the Stone for himself. He wants the Stone for Voldemort. With the Elixer of
    Life Voldemort will be strong again. He'll... come back. 
 But if he comes back, you don't think he'd try to... kill you? Do you? 
 I think if he'd had the chance, he might have tried to kill me tonight.
     
 And to think I've been worrying about my Potions final. 
 No. We're forgetting one thing. Who's the one wizard Voldemort always
    feared? 
 Dumbledore. As long as Dumbledore's around, you're safe,
    Harry. As long as Dumbledore's around...you can't be touched. 
 I'd always heard Hogwarts' end of year exams were frightful. But I found
    that rather enjoyable. Weren't you stunnei:l not to be asked about Elfric the Eager? 
 I'm stunned my head didn't explode. Alright there, Harry? 
 My scar. Keeps... burning. 
 It's happened before... 
 Not like this... 
 No... 
 Harry? 
 Don't you think it's a bit odd, that what Hagrid wants more than anything is a
    dragon? And a stranger turns up who just happens to have one? I mean, how many people wander
    around with dragon eggs in their pocket? Why didn't I see it before? 
 Ne'er saw his face... Kept his hood up. 
 Didn't that strike you as unusual? 
 Yeh meet a lot o' unusual types in the village. Ain't 'xactly usual meself. 
 This stranger, though. talked... You and he must've... 
 He asked what I did, the sorta creatures I look after. Tol' him after Fluffy
    a dragon would be easy. 
 And did he seem interested in Fluffy? 
 Well, yeah. How many three-headed dogs do yeh meet, even if yeh're in the
    trade? So I tells 'im, this stranger, the trick with any beast is ter know what calms 'em. Take
    Fluffy, fer example. Jus' play 'im a bit o' music an' he'll go straight off ter sleep-- 
 I shouldn'ta tol' yeh that! Forget I said it!
    Hey! Where yeh goin'! Hey! 
 We have to see Professor Dumbledore. Immediately. 
 I see. Well, I'm afraid Professor Dumbledore is not here. Only moments
    ago, he received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and flew off to London. 
 He's gone? Now? But this is important! This is about... the Sorcerer's
     Stone.
 How do you know-- 
 Someone's going to try and steal it. 
 Nonsense. I don't know how you three found out about the Stone, but I
    assure you it is well protected. Now, run along. 
 That was no stranger Hagrid met in the village. It was Snape. Which means be
    knows how to get past Fluffy. 
 And with Dumbledore gone... 

    
 Good afternoon. 
 Now what would three fine Gryffindors such as yourselves be doing inside on such
    a lovely day? 
 We were just... 
 You want to be careful. People will think you're... up to something. 
 What do we do now? 
 Go through the trapdoor. Tonight. 
 Trevor! Shh! Go! You shouldn't be here! 
 Neither should you. 
 You're sneaking out again, aren't you? 
 Now, Neville, listen... 
 No! I won't let you. You'll get Gryffindor in trouble again. I'll... I'll
    fight you! You were the ones who told me I had to stand up to people! 
 To people. Not us. 
 Neville. I'm really, really sorry about this. 
 Petrificus Totalus! 
 You're a little scary sometimes, you know that? Brilliant. But scary. 
 Who's there? Know you're there, even if I can't see you. Are you ghoulie or
    ghostie or wee student beastie? 
 Never mind. 
 That was close.
 Sorry. I get hungry when I'm nervous. 
 Wait a minute. He's... 
 Snoring.
 Suppose we won't be needing this now. Look, its obvious Snape's already got
    past Fluffy. If you two want to go back-- 
 Don't be stupid. 
 We're coming. 
 Right then. All together now. 
 I'll go first. Don't follow until I
    give you a sign. If something... bad happens... get yourselves out-- 

    Does it seem a bit... quiet...to you? 
 The harp... what happened to the--
 Yuck! What's this ruddy stuff-- 
 That was...cool. 
 We must be miles under the school. 
 Lucky this plant thing's here, really. 
 Wo! 
 Wo! 
 Stop moving! Both of you! This is Devil 's Snare! You have to relax. 
 Uh, Hermione, it's a bit difficult to relax... 
 ...given the circumstances. 
 I know, Harry. But you must. If you don 't, it'll only kill you faster. 
 Kill us faster? Oh now I can relax. As they watch, Hermione takes a LONG, SLOW
    BREATH and... is SUCKED beneath the surface... VANISHING. 
 Hermione! 
 What are we going to do now! 
 Just relax. 

    
 Hermione? But how... where? 

    
 Do what I say! 
 I suggest we do what she says. 
 He's not relaxing, is he? 
 Apparently not. 
 Devil's Snare, Devil's Snare. Dances in the dark, delights in the damp...
   
 Is she doing a poem? It's not possible she's doing a poem, is it? 
 It's deadly fun, but will... sulk in the sun! That's it! Light! Devil's
    Snare. hates the light! 
 Lucky we didn't panic. 
 Lucky Hermione pays attention in Herbology. 
 What is that? 
 I don't know... sounds like wings. 
 Curious. I've never seen birds like these... 
 They're not birds... 
 They're keys. And I'll bet one
    of them fits that door. 

   
 Locked. 
 Alohomora! 
 Well, it was worth a try. 

    
 So what do we do? There must be a thousand keys up there... 

    
 We're looking for a big, old-fashioned one--probably silver,
    like the handle. There! That one, see! With the bright blue wings! 
 What's wrong with its wing? 
 The feather's pinched. Probably from Snape catching it before us. 
 Harry? 
 It's... too simple. 
 Oh, go on, Harry. If Snape could catch it on that old CleanSweep, you can. It's
    not for nothing you're the youngest Seeker in a Century. 
 Well,this complicates things a bit. 
 He'll be torn to pieces. 

   
 I don't like this. I don't like this at all.
 Where are we? A graveyard? 
 This is no graveyard... 
 It's a chessboard.
     

   
 But what're we to do? 
 It's obvious, isn't it? We've got to play our way across the room. Excuse me...
    are we meant to join you? 
 Brilliant. 
 Now don't be offended, but neither of you are particularly good at chess- 
 Just tell us what to do. 
 All right. Harry, you take the empty Bishop's square. Hermione--you'll be the
    Queenside castle. As for me... 

    ...I'll be a Knight. 
 What happens now? 
 We play. 
 Ron, you don't suppose this is going to be like real wizard's chess, do
    you? 
 You there... d5 
 Yes, Hemione. I think this is going to be exactly like wizard's chess.
     

    Think...Think... 
 Castle to... c3 
 Wait a minute... 
 She's made the same
    mistake I always make. If I go there, she has to take me, and the Ring is exposed! 
 There's just one problem with that. It's you that has to go on, Harry. I know
    it. Not me. Not Hermione. You. 
 No, Ron... 
 What is it? 
 He's going to sacrifice himself. 
 No. There has to be another way! 
 Do you want to stop Snape from getting the Stone or not! 
 You understand, right, Harry? Once I make my move, the Queen will take me. Then
    you're free to check the King. 
 No! 
 Don't forget we're still playing.
     

    
 Checkmate. 
 If you can, go to the owlery and send
    a message to Dumbledore. Ron's right. I have to go on. 
 You're a great wizard, Harry Potter! You are, you know! 

    
 Not as good as you. 
 Me! Books. And cleverness. There are more important things--friendship and
    bravery and--oh, Harry, be careful! 
 You! 
 No. It can't
    be. Snape... 
 Mm, yes, he does seem the type, doesn't he? So useful Snape. Swooping
    around like an overgrown bat. Next to him, who would suspect p-poorr st- stuttering Professor
    Quirrell? 
 But that day, during the Quidditch match... Snape to kill me. 
 No, dear boy, I tried to kill you. And, trust me, if Snape's cloak hadn't
    caught fire and broken my eye contact, I would've succeeded. Even with Severus muttering his
    little countercurse. 
 Snape was trying to save me? 
 Oh, don't misunderstand. He hates you, just as he hated your father when
    they were at Hogwarts together. But he never wanted you dead. Your father, after all, saved his
    life once, long ago. 
 Didn't know?
    Surprising, given how curious you are Potter. I knew you were a danger to me right off.
    Especially after Halloween. 
 You let the Troll in. 
 Yes. I have a way with trolls. Snape, unfortunately, wasn't fooled. While
    everyone else was running about the dungeons, he went straight to the Third Floor to head me
    off. That three headed dog didn't even manage to bite Snape's leg off properly. He of course,
    never trusted me again. Rarely left me alone.. But he doesn't understand. I am never alone.
    Never... 
 Now what does this mirror do? I see what I desire, I see
    myself holding the Stone. But how do I get it? 

    
 Use the boy. 
 Come here, Potter 

    
 What is it? What do you see? 
 I... I'm shaking hands with Dumbledore. I... I've won the House cup. 

    
 He lies. 
 Tell the truth! What do you see? 

    
 Let me speak to him. 
 Master, you are not strong enough. 

    
 I have strength enough... for this. 

    
 Voldemort. 
 Harry Potter. We meet... again. 
 Yes. You see
    what I've become. Unicorn blood can sustain me, but it cannot give me a body of my own. But
    there is something that can. Something that, conveniently enough... lies in your pocket...
     
 Stop him! 
 Don't be a £ool, Harry. Why suffer a horrific death, when you can join
    me... and live. 
 Never! 
 Ah, bravery. Your parents had it too. Tell me, Harry... would you like to
    see your mother and father again? 
 Together, we
    can bring them back. All I ask... is for something in return. 
 That's it, Harry. There is no
    good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to seek it. Together, we'll do
    extraordinary things. Just... give me the Stone. 
 Liar! 
 Kill him! 
 Wh-what is this magic? 
 Fool! Get the Stone! 
 Of Harry. Lying on the floor. The Stone glimmering dully in his
    palm. 
 Good afternoon, Harry. 
 Tokens from your admirers. 
 Admirers? 
 What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is
    a complete secret--so naturally the whole school knows. Your friend Ronald has saved you the
    trouble of opening your chocolate frogs. Though one suspects Agrippa and Ptolemy still elude
    him. 
 Ron was here? Is he all right? What about Hermione-- 
 Fine. Both of them. Madame Pomfrey has explicitly forbidden visitors. But
    I think--with the help of a certain cloak-- they've managed to monitor your progress. 
 But what happened to the-- 
 Relax, dear boy. The Stone has been destroyed. My friend Nicolas and I
    had a little chat and agreed it was best all around. 
 But then, Flamel... he'll die, won't he? 
 He has enough Elixir to set his affairs in order. But, yes, he will die.
    To one as young as you, I'm sure it seems incredible. But to the well-organized mind, death is
    but the next great adventure. 
 But to destroy such a remarkable thing... 
 Yes, yes. As much money and life as one could ever want--the two things
    most human beings would choose above all else. Unfortunately, humans do have a knack for
    choosing precisely those things that are worst for them. 
 How is it I got the Stone, Sir? One minute I was staring in the mirror-- 
 Ah. You see, only a person who wanted to find the Stone--find it, but not
    use it-would be able to get it. One of my more brilliant ideas and, between you and me, that's
    saying something. 
 Does that mean--with the Stone gone, that is--that Voldemort can never come
    back? 
 I'm afraid there are other ways for him to return. And when--if--he does,
    it will take someone willing to fight a losing battle to stop him again. Someone like your
    parents. Someone like you. 

    
 Professor Dumbledore. Voldemort said... if I gave him the Stone, he
    could bring back my...family. Could he have, sir? Really? 
 Some people are like mirrors, Harry. They reflect our most desperate
    desires. We see what they want us to see. As painful as it surely was... you made the right
    choice. 
 Do you know why
    Professor Quirrell couldn't bear to touch you, Harry? It's because of your mother. She
    sacrificed herself for you. And that kind of act leaves a mark. 
 No, this kind of mark cannot be seen. It lives in your very skin. It is the very
    thing someone like Professor Quirrell-full of hatred and greed--cannot understand. Or bear to
    touch. 
 What is it? 
 Love, Harry. Love. 
 Ah! Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans! I was unfortunate enough in my youth to
    come across a vomit flavored one, and since then I'm afraid I've lost my liking for them. But I
    think I'll be safe with a nice toffee. 
 Alas! Ear wax! 
 All right there, Ron? 
 All right. You? 
 All right. Hermione? 
 Never better. 
 D'you think Dumbledore meant for it all to happen'? And for you to do it'?
    Sending you your father's cloak and all? 
 Well,if he did-- I mean--that's terrible. You could have been killed. Come
    to think of it, I could've been killed... 
 I think Dumbledore knows pretty much everything that goes on here. The only
    thing I don't understand is Snape... 
 Professor Snape, Potter. 
 Yes, of course. I was only wondering. Is it true? Did he hate my father? 
 They were not compatible personalities, if that's what you mean. And
    then, of course, your father did something Severus could never forgive. 
 What was that? 
 He saved his life. 
 I suppose he felt it his... obligation ...to look after you this year. 
 Of course! And now that he's squared things, he can hate Harry in peace, right,
    Professor? 
 Hogwarts teachers do not hate their students, Mr. Weasley...
     
 No matter how taxing they may be. 
 I think she's warming up to me. 
 Another year gone! Now as I understand it, the House Cup needs awarding,
    and the points stand thus: In fourth place, Gryffindor, with 312. 
 You'd think saving the bloody school from a Dark Lord would count for something. 
 In third place, Hufflepuff, with 352.In second, Ravenclaw, with 426. And
    in first place, with 472 points... Slytherin House. 
 Yes, well done,
    Slytherin. However, recent events must be taken into account. I have a few last minute points to
    award. 
 First, to Miss
    Hermione Granger, for the cool use of intellect when others were in grave peril... fifty points.
     
 Second, to Mr. Ronald
    Weasley, for the best played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in many years... fifty points. 
 My youngest brother, you know! 
 Third, to Mr. Harry Potter, for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I
    award Gryffinder House... sixty points.
 Oh my goodness. We've tied Slytherin! 
 And finally... it takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our
    enemies, but even more to stand up to our friends. I therefore award 10 points to Mr. Neville
    Longbottom. 
 Assuming my calculations are correct, I believe a change of
    decoration is in order. 
 Come on now, Harry. 
 Didn' think yeh'd be leavin' without sayin' goodbye, didya? 

    That there's fer you to open on the train. Which seems to be leavin', by the way. 
 Go on now. An'
    Harry? If tha' dolt of a cousin o' yers Dudley gives yeh any grief, yeh can always threaten ter
    give 'im a pair o' ears ter go with that tail of 'is. 
 But Hagrid. We' re not allowed to do magic away from Hogwarts. You know that. 
 I do... 
 But yer cousin don't. 
 Feels strange, doesn't it? To be going home. 
 I'm not going home... Not really.
