Dumbledore’s hand finds his shoulder and Harry is moving,
drifting through the chaos, Dumbledore protective,
graceful, dignified.

light has caught one worker’s eye, then another, and soon they are all rising, stepping to the window, mesmerized by what lies beyond.

as if about to rain blood over the city. We -CUT

itself and... 
... PLUMMET, London expanding, stretching out on all sides. We SWEEP madly OVER Charing Cross, leaving theMuggle world behind and SWOOP INTO... 
3 EXT. DIAGON ALLEY - DAY 3 
... Diagon Alley just as the front window of OLLIVANDER’SWAND SHOP EXPLODES. Witches and wizards flee. In the 
drifting smoke, DEATH EATERS appear, accompanied by at all, sinewy beast of a man, FENRIR GREYBACK. With a 
casual sweep of his hand he sends a wizard flying and a witch screams. In deep b.g., two Death Eaters abduct a 
SHROUDED FIGURE (Ollivander). Greyback grins, thenAPPARATES, along with the others... 
... leaving Diagon Alley behind. The streets of London 
appear below once more, and then the river. Black trails 
-- the Death Eaters -- streak across the sky and then turn TRANSLUCENT as they encircle the MILLENNIUM BRIDGE.
Pedestrians peer upward, bewildered, sensing a shift in the atmosphere. And then... 
The BRIDGE CRUMBLES into the THAMES, the image horrifyingly beautiful, as is the SOUND of it, a ROAR, a wail, the last cry of a lion. Then the image begins to FADE and all goes slowly SILENT, until only a WHISTLING WIND is heard and... 
4 EXT. MILL TOWN - LATE AFTERNOON 4 
... tall grasses toss dreamily in a SLANTING RAIN. An 
OLD MILL lists like an ancient ruin against a charcoal sky. A DARK FIGURE (NARCISSA MALFOY) MATERIALIZES. As 
she turns for the town in the distance, another witch 
materializes: BELLATRIX LESTRANGE. 
*
 
Narcissa! 
BELLATRIX 




5 EXT. SPINNER’S END - LATE AFTERNOON (MOMENTS LATER) 
Like a rat in a maze, Narcissa makes her way through a labyrinth of dilapidated brick houses. Bellatrix trails. 
BELLATRIX 
Cissy! You mustn’t do this. He 
can’t be trusted.

NARCISSA 
The Dark Lord trusts him. 
BELLATRIX 
The Dark Lord is mistaken. 
Narcissa turns, shocked. Bellatrix looks shocked 
herself, rain running down her cheeks. 
BELLATRIX 
Or so I believe. 
* 
NARCISSA 
Well, who can one trust these 
days? 
6 INT. MILL HOUSE - SAME TIME - LATE AFTERNOON 6 
Grim and dark, lit by guttering candles. RAIN drums the 
roof eerily. A KNOCKER CLANGS. A SQUAT MAN SHUFFLES 
forth, something familiar in his gait.

7 EXT. HOUSE (SPINNER’S END) - SAME TIME - LATE AFTERNOON 
The door cracks, spilling sallow light onto Narcissa andBellatrix. A face: WORMTAIL.

8 INT. HALLWAY - LATE AFTERNOON (MOMENTS LATER) 
The sisters follow Wormtail down a narrow hallway. 
BELLATRIX 
He lives in this Muggle dunghill? 
Wormtail glowers over his shoulder at her. They pass into...

... a room where a MAN sits by the window running withRAIN, his face hidden by the Daily Prophet.

On the front page is a PHOTOGRAPH of the MILLENNIUM BRIDGE CRASHING INTO THE THAMES. But even more prominent is the SILHOUETTE of a YOUNG WIZARD and a HEADLINE: 
HARRY POTTER: THE CHOSEN ONE? 
Young Wizard Destined to Kill You-Know-Who? 
The paper drops and SEVERUS SNAPE eyes the women curiously. 
SNAPE 
Run along, Wormtail. 
10 INT. MILL HOUSE - SITTING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON (MOMENTS LATER)

Snape fills the last of three goblets with wine. 
NARCISSA 
I’ve nowhere else to turn, 
Severus. 
Snape hands her a goblet, extends one to Bellatrix. 
BELLATRIX 
You must be joking. 
Snape smiles faintly, brings the goblet to his own lips. 
NARCISSA 
I know I ought not to be here.
The Dark Lord himself has 
forbidden me to speak of this -SNAPE 
If the Dark Lord has forbidden it, 
you ought not to speak.
(eyes shifting)
Put it down, Bella. We mustn’t 
touch what isn’t ours. 
Bellatrix, DARK CURIO in hand, glowers, sets it backdown. 
SNAPE 
As it so happens I’m aware of your situation, Narcissa. 
You? 
BELLATRIX 
The Dark Lord told you? 
SNAPE 
Your sister doubts me, Narcissa. 
Understandable.

Bellatrix makes a scathing sound.

Snape turns, eyes 
SNAPE 
Dumbledore is a great wizard.
Only a fool would question it. 
NARCISSA 
I... I don’t doubt you, Severus. 
BELLATRIX 
You should feel honored, Cissy.
As should Draco -NARCISSA 
He’s just a boy! 
SNAPE 
I can’t change the Dark Lord’s mind. But it might be possible for me to help Draco. To provide some... protection. 
Bellatrix eyes Snape keenly. 
NARCISSA 
Do you mean it, Severus? 
I can try. 
SNAPE 
NARCISSA 
Oh, Severus, please, if you would... (I would be forever in your debt.) 
* 
* 
Swear to it. 
BELLATRIX 
Snape’s eyes shift, meet Bellatrix’s challenging gaze. 
BELLATRIX 
Make the Unbreakable Vow. 
(as Snape looks away)
You see. It’s just empty words.
Oh he’ll try. He’ll give it his best effort. But when it matters 
most he’ll slither back into his 
hole. Bloody coward... 






Bellatrix goes on MUTTERING as she splashes some wine into a goblet. Snape turns back, anger flashing in his 
eyes. 

SNAPE 
Take out your wand. 

Bellatrix freezes, goblet to her lips. As she lowers it, 
a rivulet of red runs out of the corner of her mouth. 

NEW ANGLE - MOMENTS LATER 

Snape faces Narcissa. Bellatrix, hand faintly trembling,
places the tip of her wand over their LINKED hands. 

BELLATRIX 

Will you, Severus Snape, watch

over Draco Malfoy as he attempts

to fulfill the Dark Lord’s wishes. 

SNAPE 
I will. 

A SINGLE STRAND of LIQUID FIRE issues from Bellatrix’s 
wand and wends its way around their hands. 

BELLATRIX 

And will you, to the best of your

ability, protect him from harm? 

SNAPE 
I will. 

A SECOND STRAND of FIRE intertwines with the first. 

BELLATRIX 

And should it prove necessary, if

it seems Draco will fail... will 

you yourself carry out the deed

that the Dark Lord has ordered 

Draco to perform? 

Snape’s hand TWITCHES within Narcissa’s. Bellatrix 
waits. 

SNAPE 
I will. 

11 EXT. LONDON UNDERGROUND - NIGHT 11 

A TRAIN blasts through the station. 




12 EXT. “TREATS” FOOD STAND - SAME TIME - NIGHT 12 

Late. Lonely men and women loiter on the platform. At a 
food stand, patrons grimly read their TABLOID of choice.
CAMERA TRACKS PAST The Daily Mail, The Sun, The Mirror -LANDS 
ON... the Daily Prophet. The SILHOUETTE. The 
HEADLINE: “HARRY POTTER: THE CHOSEN ONE?” 

But the (unseen) reader is fixated on a SMALLER ITEM,
tucked at the bottom corner of the back page: “Malfoy Sentenced to Azkaban.” TWO PHOTOGRAPHS accompany the piece, one of LUCIUS MALFOY, another of Narcissa andDRACO MALFOY as they exit a courtroom. Draco’s eyes look distant, haunted. 

WAITRESS (O.S.)
Harry Potter. Who’s Harry Potter? 

The paper drops, reveals... Harry. He glances up at theYOUNG WAITRESS who stands over him. Pretty. Very 
pretty. 

HARRY 

Oh. Um. No one. Bit of a 

tosser. 

As she leans over to clear his chips wrappings, Harry’s gaze drifts over the smooth skin of her neck, the spray of freckles across one cheek... 

WAITRESS 

Funny that paper of yours. Couple

nights ago, I could swear I saw

one of the pictures move. 

HARRY 
Really. 

WAITRESS 
Thought I’d gone round the twist. 

She makes a face, smiles. A smile to die for. Starts to 
go. 

HARRY 
Hey. I was wondering... 

WAITRESS 
Eleven. That’s when I get off.

(the smile)

You can tell me all about that 

tosser Harry Potter. 

Harry watches her go, then quickly reaches into his coat and fumbles out a S’Mints container. Just then... 






... a LIGHT on the opposite PLATFORM FLICKERS. Harry looks. It FLICKERS again and this time a small cloud ofGLITTERING DUST dances over the opposite platform. As a 
TRAIN ROARS past, Harry squints through the flickering windows and watches the dust transform into... ALBUS 
DUMBLEDORE. Leveling his glasses, he peers across the platform, smiles and gives Harry a wave. 

13 EXT. OPPOSITE PLATFORM - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 13 

As Harry arrives, he finds Dumbledore studying a PERFUME ADVERTISEMENT which shows a MODEL with a WAND in her 
teeth: “Tonight Make a Little Magic With Your Man.” 

DUMBLEDORE 

I once knew a Muggle girl from

Liverpool with hair like spun

silk. No light could resist it...

(turning)

You’ve been reckless this summer, 

Harry. 

HARRY 

I like riding round on the trains.

It takes my mind off... things. 

Harry hesitates, notices Dumbledore’s hand is ASH BLACK. 

DUMBLEDORE 

Rather unpleasant to behold, isn’t

it? The tale is thrilling if I do

say so myself, but I’m afraid now

is not the time to tell it. Take 

my arm.

(extending it)
Do as I say. 

Harry glances across the platform, sees the freckledWaitress appear, eye his empty table. Slowly, he reaches out and -- instantly -- all goes BLACK in a RUSH of SOUND and FURY, as if Harry had been pitched headlong into a tornado. Seconds later... 

14 EXT. VILLAGE SQUARE - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 14 

... he re-emerges into the world, reeling, eyes stinging with tears. Slowly, his planet stops spinning. 

HARRY 
I just Apparated, didn’t I? 






DUMBLEDORE 

Indeed. And quite successfully I

might add. Most people vomit

their first time. 

HARRY 
Can’t imagine why... 

NEW ANGLE - MOMENTS LATER 

Dumbledore leads Harry up a steep narrow street lined with darkened houses. 

DUMBLEDORE 

Welcome to the charming village of

Budleigh Babberton, Harry. I 

assume right about now you’re

wondering why I’ve brought you

here, am I right? 

HARRY 

(glancing about)

After all these years, I just sort 

of roll with it, sir. 

Dumbledore smiles mildly, then pauses, his face darkening. Before them stands a SMALL STONE HOUSE. But 
something is wrong about the place. 

DUMBLEDORE 
Wand out, Harry. 

15 INT. SLUGHORN’S HOUSE - SAME TIME - NIGHT 15 

THROUGH a crack in the front door: Dumbledore and Harry move swiftly up the walk and enter. 

DUMBLEDORE 

Lumos... 

The tip of Dumbledore’s WAND BLAZES. He sweeps the shadows. CALLS OUT. 

DUMBLEDORE 

Horace! 

Nothing. Dumbledore points his wand down a NARROW HALLWAY. Motes of dust dance in the wandlight, but nothing else. He starts down the hallway, toward theOPEN DOORWAY at its end. Slowly, the room beyond comesINTO VIEW: 




16 INT. SLUGHORN’S HOUSE - SITTING ROOM - NIGHT 16 

Utter devastation. A GRANDFATHER CLOCK lays upon the floor, its face cracked. A PIANO sags in the corner,
keys strewn like teeth upon the rug. A copy of the DailyProphet trembles in the breeze from a half-open window.
As Harry looks, a DROP of something WET strikes the word“CHOSEN.” His gaze rises. 

He GASPS. A substance DARK and GLUTINOUS is spattered upon the ceiling. Dumbledore raises his wand. The 
ceiling SCREAMS RED. Another drop falls and this one strikes Harry’s SCAR. As Harry moves to wipe it away,
Dumbledore grabs his hand. 

Training his light on Harry’s forehead, Dumbledore flicks a blackened finger over the scar. Brings it to his 
tongue. Reacts. Turning, his eyes narrow on anOVERSTUFFED ARMCHAIR. Moving to it, he JABS his wand into the plump seat cushion. 

ARMCHAIR 

Merlin’s Beard! 

Instantly, the Armchair mutates into HUMAN FORM, though briefly gets caught in between. After a bit of GRUMBLING, 
SEAM-SPLITTING and the POPPING of a cushion button or 
two, a FAT OLD MAN (HORACE SLUGHORN) in a pair of WELL WORN 
lilac pajamas appears. 

SLUGHORN 

(rubbing his rump)

There’s no need to disfigure me,

Albus! 

DUMBLEDORE 

I must say, you make a very

convincing armchair, Horace. 

SLUGHORN 
It’s all in the upholstery.

(patting his stomach)

I come by the stuffing naturally.

What gave me away? 

DUMBLEDORE 
(nodding to the ceiling)
Dragon’s blood. 

SLUGHORN 

Yes, well, I couldn’t very well

use wizard’s blood, could I? Oho! 








Slughorn takes a step back, having spotted Harry. The 
blood on Harry’s forehead only serves to highlight his 
scar. 

DUMBLEDORE 
Ah yes. Introductions. Harry,
this is an old friend and 
colleague of mine, HoraceSlughorn. Horace, this is, well, 
you know who this is.

(a droll whisper)
Apparently there’s some thought he may be the Chosen One. 

Slughorn stares at Harry as if hypnotized. 

DUMBLEDORE 
So why all the theatrics, Horace?
You weren’t perhaps expecting someone else, were you? 

SLUGHORN 

(blinking)
S-someone else? I’m sure I don’t 
know what you mean. 

Dumbledore raises an eyebrow. Slughorn caves. 

SLUGHORN 
Oh all right! The Death Eaters 
have been trying to recruit me for 
over a year. Do you know what that’s like? One can only say no to these people so many times before they... 

DUMBLEDORE 
Take matters into their own hands? 

Slughorn eyes Dumbledore miserably, gestures. 

SLUGHORN 
I never stay anywhere more than a 
week. The Muggles who own this place are in the Canary Islands. 

DUMBLEDORE 
Well, I think it should be put back in order for them, don’t you?
Mind? 






Dumbledore raises his wand. Instantly, the grandfather clock resumes its rightful place, shattered lanterns reignite 
and the blood on the ceiling evaporates -- just as the piano keys tumble back into place with a pleasant MUSICAL run. 

DUMBLEDORE 
That was fun. May I use the loo? 

As Dumbledore heads down the hall, Slughorn calls after. 

SLUGHORN 
Don’t think I don’t know why you’re here, Albus! The answer is 
still no! Absolutely,
unequivocally no! 

Dumbledore doesn’t respond. Slughorn glances at Harry.
The silence is palpable. Awkward. A beat. Then: 

SLUGHORN 
You look very like your father.
Except for your eyes. You’ve 
got --

HARRY 
My mother’s eyes, yeah. 

SLUGHORN 

(smiling softly)
Lily. Lovely Lily. She was 
exceedingly bright -- your mother.
Even more impressive when one considers she was Muggle-born. 

HARRY 
One of my best friends is Muggle-
born. She’s the best in our year. 

SLUGHORN 
Oh, but you mustn’t think I’m prejudiced! No, no, no! Your 
mother was one of my absolute favorites! Look, there she is. 
Right up front.  

Slughorn waves to a dresser crowded with PHOTOGRAPHS. 

SLUGHORN 
All mine, each and every one. Ex-
students, I mean. You recognize Barnubas Cuffe, of course, editor 
of the Daily Prophet. 

(MORE)

SLUGHORN (CONT'D) 
Always takes my owl should I want to register my opinion on the news of the day. And there’s Ambrosius 
Flume of Honeydukes. Sends a 
hamper of chocolate to the house each birthday. That is, when I 
had a house. And Gwenog Jones,
captain of the Holyhead Harpies --
free tickets whenever I want them. 
Of course, I haven’t been to a 
match in some time... 
13. 
16 
Harry steps forward, takes a picture of one particularBOY, a boy who resembles... Sirius. Seeing Harry thus distracted, he studies him intently, like a rare object. 
SLUGHORN 
Ah yes. Regulus Black. You no 
doubt know of his older brother 
Sirius. Died a few weeks ago. I 
taught the whole Black family 
except Sirius. Shame. Talented 
boy. I got Regulus when he came along, of course, but I’d have liked the set. 
DUMBLEDORE 
Mind if I take this? I do love 
knitting patterns. 
Slughorn blinks, looks away from Harry and finds Dumbledore standing there, clutching a MUGGLE MAGAZINE. 
Of course. 
leaving? 
SLUGHORN 
But you’re not 
DUMBLEDORE 
I think I know a lost cause when I 
see one. Regrettable. I would 
have considered it a personal triumph had you consented to return to Hogwarts, Horace. You 
are, like my friend Mr. Potter --
one of a kind. 
17 EXT. SLUGHORN’S HOUSE - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 17 
Dumbledore HUMS placidly as he and Harry make their way down the walk. Seconds later, the front door swings 
open. 




17 


14. 
17 
SLUGHORN 
All right! I’ll do it. But I’ll 
be wanting ProfessorMerrythought’s old office, not that water closet I had formerly.
And I expect a raise! These are 
mad times we live in! Mad! 
DUMBLEDORE 
Indeed they are. 
18 EXT. STREET (BUDLEIGH BABBERTON) - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 18 
Dumbledore leads Harry back toward the Village Square. 
HARRY 
Sir, exactly what was that all --
DUMBLEDORE 
You are talented, famous and 
powerful -- everything Horace values. Professor Slughorn is going to try to collect you,
Harry. You would be his crowning jewel. That is why he is returning to Hogwarts. And it is 
crucial he return... 
Harry looks intrigued by this last statement, but before he can pursue it, Dumbledore glances ruefully at the 
moon. 
DUMBLEDORE 
I fear I may have stolen a wondrous night from you, Harry.
She was, truthfully, very pretty.
The girl. 
HARRY 
It’s alright, sir. I’ll go back tomorrow, make some excuse --
Harry stops. Dumbledore is shaking his head. 
DUMBLEDORE 
You’ll not be going back to Little Whinging tonight, Harry. 
HARRY 
But, sir. What about Hedwig?
there’s my trunk --
And 






DUMBLEDORE 
Both are waiting for you. 

Dumbledore extends his arm. Mystified, Harry reaches 
out. As his fingers touch the silk of Dumbledore’s cloak, he... 

19 EXT. THE BURROW - NIGHT (SECONDS LATER) 19 

... APPARATES INTO VIEW, stumbling to one knee and wincing. 

HARRY 
Sir? 

Dumbledore is gone. Harry rises, glances about. In the 
distance a CROOKED HOUSE shimmers. A PRETTY GIRL with 
RED HAIR flits briefly past an upstairs window. GINNY 
WEASLEY. 

20 INT. WEASLEY HOUSE - STAIRCASE - SAME TIME - NIGHT 20 

Ginny DASHES down a vertiginous staircase, flies into the kitchen and finds... 

21 INT. WEASLEY HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT 21 

... a LARGE TRUNK and an OWL CAGE. Curious, she cocks 
her head to one side. The owl does the same in return. 

GINNY 
Hedwig...? Mum! 

22 INT. WEASLEY HOUSE - DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - SAME TIME - NIGHT22 

GINNY’S POV, looking up -- a dizzying perspective of 
twisting railings and crooked bedroom doors. A CLOCK 
hangs IN VIEW, bearing NINE HANDS, each inscribed with aWeasley name, each pointing to MORTAL PERIL. MRS. 
WEASLEY appears, looks down. 

MRS. WEASLEY 

What is it, Ginny? Is it your

father? Has something happened at

the Ministry? Has he been 

kidnapped? Is it the Death 

Eaters? 

GINNY 
Exactly. How’d you guess? 






Mrs. Weasley throws her hands up over her face. 

GINNY 
I’m joking, Mum. 

MRS. WEASLEY 
You’re worse than Fred and George. 

GINNY 
Now you’re joking. I was only wondering when Harry got here. 

MRS. WEASLEY 
Harry who? 

GINNY 
Harry Dimpleton. Harry Potter, of 
course. 

MRS. WEASLEY 
I think I’d know if Harry Potter was in my house, wouldn’t I? 

GINNY 
Well his trunk’s in the kitchen. 
And his owl. 

MRS. WEASLEY 
I seriously doubt that. 

Just then, HEDWIG SCREECHES O.S. Ginny gives her an I-
told-you-so when another door opens and RON WEASLEY looks down. 

RON 
Harry? Did someone say Harry? 

GINNY 
Me, nosy. Is he up there with you? 

RON 
‘Course not. Think I’d know if my best friend was in my room,
wouldn’t I? 

Another door opens: HERMIONE, in a robe, TOOTHBRUSH in 
hand. 

HERMIONE 
Was that an owl I heard? 







GINNY 

Harry’s. Haven’t seen him, have 

you? Apparently, he’s wandering

about the house. 

HERMIONE 
Really? 

HARRY (O.S.)
Really. 

Ginny spins. Harry. Standing in the doorway of the kitchen. 

RON/HERMIONE/MRS. WEASLEY 
Harry! 

As the others rocket downstairs, Ginny gives Harry a great grinning hug. There is something oddly charged in the moment, a surprise to both of them. The others 
arrive. More hugs. 

MRS. WEASLEY 

But why didn’t you tell us you

were coming? 

HARRY 
Didn’t know. 
(a shrug)  
Dumbledore. 

MRS. WEASLEY 

That man. But then, what would we 

do without him? Ron! 

Ron is about to touch Hermione. She retracts her neck. 

RON 
You’ve a bit of... 

He gestures to the stray lace of toothpaste on Hermione’s chin. Quickly she wipes it off, gives him an odd look. 

EXT. THE BURROW - ATTIC - NIGHT (LATER)

23 23 

The Daily Prophet tumbles within a makeshift campfire ofBLUE FLAMES, but magically doesn’t disintegrate. Harry teases the fire with the tip of his wand, where The 
Chosen One? mingles with Draco’s haunted face in the 
flames. 

HARRY 
When’d you get here? 






HERMIONE 
A few days ago. Though... for a bit, I wasn’t sure I was coming. 

Harry looks up, sees her glance at Ron. 

RON 
Mum sort of lost it last week. 
Said Ginny and I had no business going back to Hogwarts. That it’s 
too dangerous. 

HARRY 
Oh come on... 

HERMIONE 
She’s not alone. Even my parents-- and they’re Muggles -- know something bad is happening. 

RON 
Anyway, Dad stepped in, told her she was being barmy. Took a day or two, but she came round. 

HARRY 
But we’re talking about Hogwarts.
Dumbledore. What could be safer? 

Hermione and Ron exchange another glance. 

HERMIONE 
There’s been a lot of chatter 
lately. That he’s gotten... old. 

HARRY 
Rubbish. He’s only -- what? 

RON 
A hundred and fifty. Give or take 
a few years. 

Silence. Nods. Then the three break out laughing. Grow 
quiet again. Harry takes another poke at the Prophet. 
Draco’s haunted face appears briefly, then is gone.

fireworks spit sparks, and Nose-Biting Teacups bare tiny porcelain teeth. FRED & GEORGE WEASLEY, in SCREAMING 
MAGENTA, stand upon a counter, selling to the masses: 

FRED/GEORGE 
Step up! Step up! 

GEORGE 
We’ve got Fainting Fancy... 

FRED 
Nosebleed Nougats... 

GEORGE 
And just in time for school... 

FRED 
Puking Pastilles! 

A BOY stops chewing, turns PALE GREEN -- literally. 

FRED/GEORGEInto the cauldron, handsome. 

Together, with the tips of their toes, Fred and George launch a SLOSHING CAULDRON down the counter, drop down on either side of Harry, begin to steer him through the 
store. 

FRED 
What’d you think, Harry? 

HARRY 
Amazing. 

GEORGE 

(to a browsing boy)

Pocket that and you’ll pay in more

than Galleons, my friend. 

FRED/GEORGE

We’ve got eyes in the back of our 

heads. 

The boy, working a SCREAMING YO-YO, blanches as Fred and 
George turn, reveal they do in fact have EYES IN THE BACK 
OF THEIR HEADS -- phony, but unnerving. As the EYES 
WINK, the tiny boy bolts. 

GEORGE 
Bloody urchins. 

Harry eyes a display of ORANGE AND BLACK LUMPS. 







HARRY 
Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder? 

FRED 
A real money spinner that. 

FRED 
Handy if you need to make a quick 
escape. Hello, ladies! 

George drops one of the lumps in Harry’s hand, turns to Ginny and Hermione, who peruse a display of “Wonder Witch Love Potions.” 

GEORGE 
Yes, they do really work. 

FRED 
Then again, the way we hear it, 
sis, you’re doing just fine on 
your own. 

GINNY 
Meaning? 

FRED 
Are you not currently dating Dean Thomas? 







Harry pretends to consider a rack of “Ten-Second PimpleVanisher,” but secretly eavesdrops. 

GINNY 
None of your business. 

HERMIONE 
These are adorable. 

Inside a cage, small round BALLS of FLUFF roll about,
SQUEAK. 

FRED 
Aren’t they now. Pygmy Puffs.
Can’t breed them fast enough. 

Just then a HUGE BOY (CORMAC McLAGGEN) passes behind Hermione and, with his eyes, takes the full measure of her. Noticing, she turns, receives a faint smile as he 
moves on. 

RON 
How much for this? 

A TINY WOODEN MAN ascends a TINY GALLOWS and... DROPS. 
George rides a rolling ladder INTO FRAME, drops next to * 
Fred.  

FRED/GEORGE
Five Galleons. 

RON 
How much for me? 

FRED/GEORGE
Five Galleons. 

RON 
But I’m your brother! 

FRED/GEORGE 
Ten Galleons. 

RON 
C’mon. Let’s go. 

The trio head for the door, passing LAVENDER BROWN, who smiles flirtatiously at an oblivious Ron. 

LAVENDER BROWN 
Hi, Ron. 

RON 
Hi. 




25 EXT. DIAGON ALLEY - LATE AFTERNOON (MOMENTS LATER) 25 
The sun fades over an IRON ARCHWAY -- Welcome to Diagon Alley! -- as Harry, Ron and Hermione pass beneath. All 
around them, SHOPS sit silent, windows BOARDED-UP or 
SHATTERED. People scurry by, avoiding the SCARY FACES of the witches and wizards who peer out from the SECURITY POSTERS plastered to every LAMP POST. Bellatrix is 
there: “KNOWN DEATH EATER,” And Greyback: “WEREWOLF.” 
And LUCIUS MALFOY: “CAUGHT.” 
HERMIONE 
How is it Fred and George are doing it? Half the alley’s closed down. 
RON 
Fred reckons people need a laughthese days. 
HARRY 
Reckon he’s right... 
Harry eyes the poster of Bellatrix, her mocking half-
smile. 
Oh no. Look. 
HERMIONE 
Harry and Ron follow her gaze to the wreck that isOllivander’s Wand Shop. 
HERMIONE 
But everyone got their wands fromOllivander. Young. Old... 
Good. Bad. 
HARRY 
Speaking of which... 
Across the avenue, DRACO MALFOY and Narcissa pause,
glance around, then slip quickly down an alley. 
RON 
Is it just me? Or do Draco and 
mummy look like two people who don’t want to be followed? 
26 EXT. VARIOUS STREETS - DIAGON ALLEY - LATE AFTERNOON 26 
The trio trail Draco and Narcissa, who navigate these dark streets with ease. Hermione, lagging a bit, glances up at the darkening sky. When she looks back, she sees 
Ron and Harry far ahead. They turn a shadowy corner,
vanish. 






NEW ANGLE - SHOP FRONT - MOMENTS LATER 

Harry and Ron duck inside a shop front. At the end of 
the alley, a single shop glimmers dully: Borgin &
Burkes. Narcissa and Draco enter, greet a STOOPED MAN(BORGIN). He POINTS. Draco walks to a LACQUERED 
CABINET, plays his fingers over its glassy surface.
Narcissa speaks and Draco turns, finds Borgin holding the curtain to the back room aside. Draco hesitates, then 
follows his mother through. 

RON 
What’re they playing at? 

HARRY 
Dunno. Let’s get closer. 

RON 
(a nod; stopping)
Hey. Where’s Hermione? 

NEW ANGLE - ANOTHER ALLEY - DUSK 

Hermione moves through the shadows, alone, peering downside streets, each darker than the next, lost, but 
holding it together, when... a SHADOW FLICKERS overhead.
She looks up, sees a FIGURE (Greyback) leap from one roof to another. She stands perfectly still, then... hearsVOICES. 

NEW ANGLE - OTHER ALLEYS - DUSK 

Harry and Ron race down one passage then another. Stop. 

RON 

Harry, where is she? 

HARRY 
I don’t know. I’m turned around. 

NEW ANGLE - BORGIN & BURKES - BACK COURTYARD - DUSK 

Hermione creeps to the end of a narrow passage, toward the VOICES, and finds herself... behind Borgin & Burkes.
FIGURES encircle an old cauldron, among them Greyback,
Bellatrix, Narcissa, and in the very center... Draco. 

Hermione squints against the brilliance of the FIRE, the FIGURES twisting like Giacomettis. Draco extends his 
left arm... when a SHADOW falls over Hermione, fingers find her arm. She wheels, terrified. 






Ron. 

HERMIONE 
Bloody hell. 

RON 
Sorry. 

Just then, the cauldron EXPLODES with light. Instantly,
the group, including Draco, disperses. 

HARRY 
What just happened? 

HERMIONE 
I don’t know. 

Harry stares at the SMOKE drifting from the cauldron. A 
SOUND RISES, growing more powerful and the ROAR of a... 

27 EXT. HOGWARTS EXPRESS - MOVING - LATE AFTERNOON 27 

... TRAIN overtakes us, the scarlet stack of the Hogwarts Express churning furiously towards the horizon. 

LUNA 

Quibbler...? Quibbler...? 

28 INT. HOGWARTS EXPRESS - AISLE - SAME TIME - LATE AFTERNOON28 

LUNA LOVEGOOD moves down the aisle wearing a pair of RED and BLUE CARDBOARD GLASSES (SPECTRESPECS) identical to the ones modeled by a witch on the cover of the current issue of The Quibbler, a stack of which Luna clutches to 
her chest. 

LUNA 

There’s an article on Wrackspurts

this month. Quibbler...? 

The loitering STUDENTS ignore her, including DEAN THOMAS,
currently WHISPERING to Ginny, who smiles mildly, more interested in the PURPLE PYGMY PUFF perched on her shoulder. 

LUNA 

He’s lovely. They’ve been known

to sing on Boxing Day, you know. 

Quibbler? 

GINNY 
Please. What’s a Wrackspurt? 




28 


24. 
28 
LUNA 
They’re invisible creatures that float in through your ears and make your brain go fuzzy.
(moving off) 
Quibbler? Quibbler? 
29 INT. COMPARTMENT - SAME TIME - DUSK 29 
Harry, Ron and Hermione sit together. Hermione has a 
book entitled Advance Rune Translation open on her lap,
while Ron lets Harry’s INVISIBILITY CLOAK play through his fingers. 

HARRY 
Don’t you see, it was a ceremony.
An initiation. 

HERMIONE 
Stop, Harry, I know where you’re going with this --

HARRY 
It’s happened. He’s one of them. 

RON 
One of what? 

HERMIONE 
Harry is under the impression that Draco Malfoy is now a Death Eater.
 
RON 
You’re barking. What would You-Know-
Who want with a sod like 
Malfoy? 

HARRY 

So what’s he doing in Borgin and Burke’s? Browsing for furniture? 
RON 
It’s a creepy shop.
bloke. 
He’s a creepy 

HARRY 
Look. His father’s a Death Eater. 
It only makes sense. Besides, 
Hermione saw it. With her own 
eyes. 

HERMIONE 
I told you. I don’t know what I saw. 






Harry rises, snatches the cloak from Ron’s hands. 

HARRY 
I need some air. 

30 INT. HOGWARTS EXPRESS - AISLE - DUSK (MOMENTS LATER) 30 

A blood-red sun shimmers through the windows, staining the interior a deep scarlet. Students read, play cards.
In one compartment, CRABBE and GOYLE slumber sloppily.
As Harry enters, the ACCORDION doors to the NEXT CAR SQUALL open and a PAIR of TWIN GIRLS emerge. He watches 
them when a VOICE causes him to turn back. As the 
accordion doors slowly close, he spies Malfoy sitting with PANSY PARKINSON and a BOY with the cheekbones of a 
sphinx (BLAISE ZABINI). 

Harry studies Malfoy when a BOY pushes through the accordion doors. As they begin to close, slowly, Harry reaches into his pocket and removes the ORANGE AND BLACK LUMP Fred gave him in Diagon Alley. He eyes Malfoy, eyes the closing door and -- impulsively -- pitches the lump into the air. It soars through the narrowing crease of the doors and -- just as Malfoy glances his way -- justas it reaches the apex of its flight -- POOF! -- explodes softly, raining DARK POWDER. 

31 EXT. HOGWARTS EXPRESS - MOVING - SAME TIME - DUSK 31 

One train car -- and only one -- goes DARK: 

32 INT. HOGWARTS EXPRESS - AISLE/COMPARTMENT - SAME TIME - DUSK32 

CHAOS. PANICKED VOICES. Then, like a thinning mist, the darkness eerily recedes, the red light of dusk returns and Malfoy is revealed, standing in the DOORWAY of the 
car. As he looks on warily, students return to their 
seats. Across the way, Crabbe & Goyle continue to slumber. 

MALFOY 
What just happened? Blaise? 

BLAISE 
(tense himself)
Don’t know. 

Just then, a SMALL BAG TEETERS... then tumbles from a 
luggage rack. Malfoy wheels, eyes the bag. 







PANSY 
Relax, boys. The lights went out is all. Come, Draco. We’ll be * 
at Hogwarts before you know it. * 
She pats the seat. Draco eyes the bag, slings it back onto the luggage rack and plops down. Pansy strokes his hair. 
MALFOY 
Hogwarts. What a pathetic excuse for a school. I think I’d pitch myself off the Astronomy Tower ifI thought I had to continue on for another two years. 
Pansy, gently twisting one of Draco’s locks, stops. 
PANSY 
What’s that supposed to mean? 
MALFOY 
Let’s just say I don’t think you’ll be seeing me wasting my time in Charms Class next year. 
Confused, Pansy glances at Blaise, who snorts derisively. 
MALFOY 
Amused, Blaise? We’ll see just who’s laughing in the end. 
Blaise shakes his head, smiling as he looks out the window at the darkness. Just then the small bag in the  upper rack shifts. Malfoy’s eyes play over it. 
33 EXT. STATION - DUSK/EVENING 33 
The Hogwarts Express steams into the station. 
34 INT. HOGWARTS EXPRESS - AISLE - SAME TIME - DUSK/EVENING 34 
Ron and Hermione step into the crowded aisle. 
HERMIONE 
Where’s Harry? 
RON 
Probably on the platform. C’mon. 




35 INT. COMPARTMENT - DUSK/EVENING 35 

As Blaise and Pansy make to exit, Malfoy takes down the small bag, grips the handle thoughtfully. 

MALFOY 

You two go on. I want to check 

something. 

Malfoy slides shut the door. LETS THE BLINDS DOWN. A 
beat. 

MALFOY 

Didn’t mummy ever tell you it’s

bad manners to eavesdrop, Potter? 

Petrificus Totalus! 

Malfoy wheels, points his wand at the luggage rack.
Something hits the floor with a THUMP. The InvisibilityCloak slips away and reveals Harry, paralyzed on the floor. Malfoy grins. 

MALFOY 

Oh, right, she was dead before you

could wipe the drool off your

chin. 

Malfoy brings his boot down hard on Harry’s face. SNAP! 
Blood squirts from Harry’s nose. Malfoy snatches up the Invisibility Cloak, pitches it over Harry. 

MALFOY 
Enjoy the ride back to London. 

36 EXT. STATION - EVENING (MOMENTS LATER) 36 

Malfoy steps off, pulls his cloak tight and disappears into the night. Softly, a SOUND rises, of a GIRL LIGHTLY HUMMING and we -


CUT TO: 

37 INT. HOGWARTS EXPRESS - AISLE - EVENING 37 

... STRANGE MOVING POV - HALF RED/HALF BLUE 

Luna Lovegood wanders down the aisle HUMMING, red and blue Spectrespecs wobbling on the bridge of her nose. Up ahead one compartment’s BLINDS are shut. Luna stopsHUMMING. Cocks her head curiously. As she does, the 
LIGHT from an overhead lantern kicks off the cheap plastic lenses of her glasses and, for the briefest of seconds, a FLUTTERING CLOUD appears. 






Of tiny insects. Or pixie dust. Or a trick of the 
light. 

38 INT. COMPARTMENT - SAME TIME - EVENING 38 

Luna’s SILHOUETTE SWELLS over the blinds, then the door 
opens. She calmly draws her wand and sends forth a blast of RED LIGHT. The Invisibility Cloak slithers fromHarry’s body. 

LUNA 
Hello, Harry. 

HARRY 
Luna. How’d you...? 

LUNA 

Wrackspurts. Your head’s full of 

them. 

39 EXT. HOGWARTS CASTLE - FRONT STEPS - NIGHT (LATER) 39 

The castle glitters. Harry, face blood-spattered, nose slightly off-center, approaches with Luna. 

HARRY 

Sorry I made you miss the

carriages, Luna. 

LUNA 

It’s alright. I enjoyed our walk.

It was like being with a friend. 

HARRY 
I am your friend, Luna. 

LUNA 
That’s nice. 

Just then PROFESSOR FLITWICK rushes forth clutching along roll of PARCHMENT bearing all students’ names. 

FLITWICK 

About time! I’ve been looking all

over for you two. Names. 

HARRY 

Professor Flitwick, you’ve known

me for five years. 

FLITWICK 
No exceptions, Potter. 






LUNA 
Who are those people? 

Harry turns, sees Luna staring into the darkness, where SHADOWS drift eerily, like ghosts. 

FLITWICK 
Aurors. For security. 

MALFOY (O.S.)
It’s a not a cane, you cretin.
It’s a walking stick. 

Harry and Luna turn. Draco stands amidst a mountain of 
TRUNKS and OWL CAGES, watching Filch pass a long SECURITY DETECTOR over a WALKING STICK. 

FILCH 
And what exactly would you be wanting with a walking stick? 

SNAPE 
It was his father’s. 

Snape separates from the shadows. Draco eyes him warily,
then snatches the stick from Filch. 

MALFOY 
Is my father’s. He’s not dead. 

Snape watches Malfoy carefully wrap the stick in felt,
lay it back inside his trunk. 

SNAPE 
It’s alright, Mr. Filch. I can 
vouch for Mr. Malfoy. 

Draco eyes Snape warily again, then begins to slouch off,
catches Harry looking. 

MALFOY 
Nice face, Potter. 

Harry puts a hand to his nose, watches Malfoy disappear into the darkness, trailed by Snape. 

LUNA 
Would you like me to fix it?
Personally I think you look a bit more devil-may-care this way. But 
it’s up to you. 

HARRY 
Have you ever fixed one? A nose. 







LUNA 
No. But I’ve done several toes 
and how different are they really? 

This does not fill Harry with confidence.
Nevertheless... 

HARRY 
What the hell. Give it a go. 






LUNA 

Episkey. 

Luna poises her wand over Harry’s nose and... gives it a TAP. It VIBRATES WILDLY and then... SNAPS into place. 

HARRY 
Well? How do I look? 

LUNA 
Exceptionally ordinary. 

HARRY 
Brilliant. 

40 INT. GREAT HALL - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 40 

Hermione cranes her neck, looking for Harry, while Ron stuffs his face with pudding, MUMBLING, MOUTH FULL: 

RON 
Don’ you worry. He’ll be ‘long soon ‘nuff --

HERMIONE 
(whacking him) 

Will. You. Stop. Eating! Your 
best friend is missing! 

RON 
Oi! Turn around, you lunatic. 

Hermione spins, sees Harry and Luna approaching. In the 
light of the hall, Harry’s blood-spattered face is quite the sight. 

GINNY 
He’s covered in blood again. Why is it he’s always covered in blood? 

RON 
Looks like his own this time. 

HERMIONE 

(as he arrives)
Where’ve you been, Harry? And 
what happened to your face? 

HARRY 
Later. What’ve I missed? 






RON 
(shrugging; still

eating)
Sorting Hat urged us all to be brave and strong in these troubled times -- easy for it to say --
it’s a hat, isn’t it? First Years 
seemed to enjoy it, though.
Wankers. Filch give you the wand outside? 

Harry nods. Ginny, damp napkin in hand, begins to dab his face, then feels suddenly awkward. Harry takes it from her. 

HARRY 
Thanks... 

Just then, the light in the Hall begins to gently dim and all eyes turn to Dumbledore, standing at the top of theHall, ashen hand raised to the enchanted ceiling, where clouds respond to his gestures and shroud a gleaming full 
moon. 

HERMIONE 
What’s happened to his hand? 

DUMBLEDORE 
The very best of evenings to you!
First off, please join me in welcoming the newest member of our staff, Horace Slughorn. 

MILD APPLAUSE ensues. Harry claps perfunctorily, his eyes drifting to the entrance of the Hall as a pair ofAurors station themselves just outside. 

DUMBLEDORE 
Professor Slughorn, I’m happy to say, has agreed to resume his old post of Potions master. Meanwhile 
the post of Defense Against theDark Arts will be assumed byProfessor Snape. 

This is greeted by stunned silence. Dumbledore frowns, 
then attempts to generate something by CLAPPING his hands 
once. A few Slytherins join in and some dim-witted FirstYears. 

DUMBLEDORE 
Now, as you know, each and everyone of you was searched upon your arrival tonight. You have a right to know why.

DUMBLEDORE (CONT'D) 

DUMBLEDORE (CONT'D) 

(a beat)

Once there was a young man who,

like you, sat in this very Hall.

Walked this castle’s corridors. 

Slept beneath its roof. He 

seemed, to all the world, a 

student like any other. His name? 

Tom Riddle. 

The Hall goes utterly silent. 

DUMBLEDORE 

Today, of course, the world knows

him by another name. Which is 

why, as I stand looking out upon

you all tonight, I am reminded of

a sobering fact. Each day, every

hour, this very minute perhaps,

dark forces attempt to penetrate

this castle. But in the end, 

their greatest weapon remains... 

you. 

Harry eyes Malfoy, slouched low, lazily levitating a fork with his wand, as if Dumbledore were unworthy of attention. 

DUMBLEDORE 

Just something to keep in mind.

Now, off to bed. Pip pip! 

RON 
(as they rise)
That was cheerful. 

41 INT. CORRIDOR - MORNING 41 

A TEEMING MASS of STUDENTS fight their way to class on first day of term. Amidst it all, McGonagall stands tall and stern. The twins pass by, bearing identical looks of consternation. 

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL 

History of Magic is up, ladies,

not down. Mr. Davies -- that’s 

the girl’s toilet... 

McGonagall’s eyes shift, find Harry and Ron sitting upon a ledge, clearly deriving immense pleasure from the chaos. 

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL 
Potter! 







Harry’s smile droops. McGonagall beckons with a finger. 

HARRY 
This can’t be good. 

Ron grins as Harry makes his way “upstream” toMcGonagall. 

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL 
Enjoying ourself, are we? 

HARRY 

Well, you see, I’ve got an open

period this morning, Professor -


PROFESSOR McGONAGALL 

So I noticed. I would think you’d

want to fill it with Potions. Or 

is it no longer your ambition to

become an Auror? 

HARRY 

It is. Or was. But I was told I 

had to get an Outstanding in my

O.W.L. -PROFESSOR 
McGONAGALL 

And so you did when Professor

Snape was teaching Potions.

However, Professor Slughorn is

perfectly happy to accept N.E.W.T.

students with ‘Exceeds 

Expectations.’ 

HARRY 

Really? Well... brilliant. I’ll 

head there straight away. 

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL 

Good. And take Weasley with you.

He looks far too happy over there. 

INT. CORRIDOR/SLUGHORN’S CLASSROOM - MORNING (MOMENTS

42 42 
LATER) 

Ron trails Harry toward an open door. * 

RON 
But I don’t want to take Potions! 




INT. SLUGHORN’S CLASSROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION - MORNING 43 

As Harry drags Ron inside, the other students turn in unison. Hermione frowns. Lavender, seeing Ron, beams. 

SLUGHORN 
Harry m’boy! I was beginning to worry! And I see we’ve brought someone with us... 

RON 
Ron Weasley, sir. But I’m dead 
awful at Potions, a menace 
actually, so I probably should just be going -


SLUGHORN 
Nonsense, we’ll sort you out. Any friend of Harry’s is a friend of mine. Right then, books out -


HARRY 
Um, sorry, sir, but I haven’t got 
my book yet -- nor’s Ron. You 
see --(until this morning...)  

SLUGHORN 
Not to worry. You can get what you need from the cupboard. 

As Harry and Ron step to the cupboard, Slughorn resumes,
gesturing to the cauldrons bubbling before him. 

SLUGHORN 
Now, as I was saying, I’ve prepared a few concoctions this morning. Any ideas what these might be? Yes, Miss...? 

HERMIONE 
Granger, sir. That one there is 
Veritaserum. And that would be 
Polyjuice Potion. And that... 

In the cupboard, Harry and Ron find two TEXTBOOKS -- one new, one shabby and soiled. Both snatch for the new when 
a box -- marked “BEZOARS” -- tips. As Harry makes a grab for it, Ron wrests free the new textbook and goes off grinning. 

HERMIONE 
... is Amortentia! The most 
powerful love potion in the world.

(MORE) 






HERMIONE (CONT'D) 

HERMIONE (CONT'D) 

It’s rumored to smell differently to each person, according to what attracts them. For example, I smell freshly mown grass and new parchment and spearmint toothpaste -


Hermione blushes, stops herself. Slughorn regards her. 

SLUGHORN 

One of my best friends is Muggle-
born. She’s the best in our 
year... 

Harry, settling into his seat with the soiled textbook,
looks up just as Slughorn’s eyes shift to him for confirmation. As Harry nods, Hermione glances curiously at him. 

SLUGHORN 
Now Amortentia doesn’t create 
actual love, of course. That’s 
impossible. But it does cause a 
powerful infatuation or obsession.
For that reason, it is probably the most dangerous potion in this 
room. 

Slughorn turns, finds a sea of dreamy faces leaning into the VAPORS. Instantly, he CLANGS a cover onto the cauldron, bringing them round. As Ron blinks, he finds 
Lavender still staring dreamily -- at him. Noticing,
Hermione’s eyes narrow. 

KATIE BELL 
Sir, you haven’t told us what’s in that one. 

SLUGHORN 
Ah yes... 

Slughorn steps to a SMALL BLACK CAULDRON. Begins to ladle a bit of GOLDEN LIQUID into a TINY VIAL. 

SLUGHORN 
What you see before you, ladies and gentlemen, is a curious little potion known as Felix Felicis. 
But it is more commonly referred 
to as -


HERMIONE 
Liquid luck. 

A buzz runs through the class. Even Malfoy perks up. 






SLUGHORN 
Yes, Miss Granger. Desperately tricky to make. Disastrous should 
you get it wrong. But brewed 
correctly, as this has been, it has remarkable powers. One sip and you will find that all your endeavors succeed... at least 
until the effects wear off. 

KATIE BELL 
But then why don’t people drink it all the time? 

SLUGHORN 
Because taken in excess it causes 
giddiness, recklessness and dangerous overconfidence. 

BLAISE 
Have you ever taken it, sir? 

SLUGHORN 
Twice. Once when I was twenty-
four. Once when I was fifty-
seven. Two tablespoons taken at 
breakfast. Two perfect days... 

Slughorn eyes the vial dreamily, adrift. Finally he blinks. 

SLUGHORN 
So. This is what I offer each of 
you today. One tiny vial of liquid luck... to the student who,
in the hour that remains, manages to brew an acceptable Draught ofLiving Death, the recipe for which can be found on page ten of your textbook. 

Excitement seizes the class. Slughorn smiles knowingly. 

SLUGHORN 
You should know that in all the 
years of my previous tenure at Hogwarts, not once did a student brew a potion of sufficient quality to claim this prize. In 
any event -- good luck. 

Slughorn sets the vial upon his desk, where it SHIMMERSin a SHAFT of SUNLIGHT. Harry opens his book. Frowns. 
The MARGINS of the page before him are black with the tight SCRIBBLINGS of a previous owner. 






The same CREEPY GRAFFITI fills the next page as well, on and on throughout the book. Shaking his head, Harry runs his finger under the first PRINTED INSTRUCTION: 

“Cut up one Sopophorous bean.” 

Harry takes the SILVER DAGGER upon his desk, poises it over the BEAN when... Ron’s bean shoots across the room 
and bounces off Katie Bell’s head. Harry surveys the rest of the room: everyone is struggling to cut the resistant legume. He glances back to his book, considers the instruction again. 

As ARROW has been drawn from the word “Cut” to the 
margin, where a modification has been written in the tight scrawl: 

“Crush with blade -- releases juice better.” 

Harry considers the dagger in his hand, then places the flat of the blade against the bean and presses.
Instantly, the protective parchment covering the desk runs RED with juice. 

HERMIONE 
How did you do that? 

HARRY 
Crush it. Don’t cut it. 

HERMIONE 

No. The instructions specifically 

say to cut. 

HARRY 
No. Really -


HERMIONE 
Sh! 

Harry shrugs, lifts the parchment and tips the juice into his cauldron. It HISSES, then turns LILAC. Harry grins.
CAMERA BEGINS SLOW DOLLY TOWARDS the vial of Felix 
Felicis and... 

MONTAGE BEGINS 

Students struggle. A cauldron overflows. Lavender eyesRon. 

CAMERA CREEPS TOWARD VIAL. THE SUNLIGHT SHIFTS. 

Hermione grows more and more frustrated. Her hair grows bushier in the steam rising from her cauldron... 






Harry’s finger traces under the official instruction...
then drifts to the spidery scrawl in the margin... 

Malfoy cuts himself, curses... 

CAMERA CREEPS CLOSER TO VIAL. SUNLIGHT SHIFTS AGAIN. 

Harry, cool as a cucumber, adds one last ingredient,
steps back, done... 

Hermione, hair like Medea now, glowers at him... 

THE LIGHT SHIFTS ONE LAST TIME. THE VIAL GLIMMERS LIKE 
GOLD. 

MONTAGE ENDS. 

ANOTHER ANGLE 

Slughorn wends his way amongst the cauldrons, nodding with sympathy at the fiascos before him. Then... he 
stops, staring in disbelief at the pearly sheen of one bubbling potion. 

SLUGHORN 

Merlin’s Beard! But it’s perfect.

So perfect I daresay one sip would

kill us all! Your mother was a 

dab hand at potions, but this...

My, my, what can’t you do, m’boy?

Perhaps you will save us all in 

the end... 

All eyes turn to Harry. His smile falters. 

SLUGHORN 

Here you are then, as promised.

One bottle of Felix Felicis. Use 

it well. 

Slowly, Harry reaches out... takes the glittering vial. 

44 EXT. CASTLE - NIGHT 44 

The Castle is dark, but for one WINDOW. 

45 INT. DUMBLEDORE’S OFFICE - SAME TIME - NIGHT 45 

Dumbledore sits alone at his desk, the deep lines of his face illuminated by the shimmering PENSIEVE. TWO OBJECTS 
of note are before him. One is a BLACK-STONED RING. The 
other is TOM RIDDLE’S DIARY. 






He briefly balances the ring upon the tip of an ashen finger, then turns a page of the battered diary. His 
face is troubled. A KNOCK. He takes the ring and diary,
slips them inside a drawer. The door swings open,
reveals Harry. 

DUMBLEDORE 
Good evening, Harry. You got my message, I see. Come, come. Sit. 

Harry steps forward, eyes the Pensieve curiously. Sits. 

DUMBLEDORE 
So. How are you? 

HARRY 
Fine, sir. 

DUMBLEDORE 
Enjoying your classes? Professor 
Slughorn, for one, is most impressed with you. 

HARRY 
I think he overestimates my abilities, sir. 

DUMBLEDORE 
Do you? 

HARRY 
Definitely. 

Dumbledore smiles affectionately, nods. 

DUMBLEDORE 
And what of your activities outside the classroom? Do they bring you satisfaction? 

HARRY 
Sir? 

DUMBLEDORE 
I notice you spend a great deal of time with Miss Granger. One can’t 
help but wonder if -


HARRY 
No! I mean... she’s brilliant. 
And we’re friends. But... no. 

DUMBLEDORE 
Forgive me, Harry, I... 







Dumbledore smiles faintly, shakes his head. 

DUMBLEDORE 
... I was merely curious.

(rising)
In any event, I’m sure you’re wondering why I’ve summoned you here tonight. The answer lies 
here. 

Dumbledore swings open a cabinet where DOZENS upon DOZENS of GLITTERING VIALS stand like tiny glimmering soldiers. 

DUMBLEDORE 
What you see before you are memories. In this case pertaining to one individual: Voldemort. Or 
as he was known then... Tom 
Riddle. 

Dumbledore reaches down with his damaged hand and removes a stoppered VIAL, dusty and veined with age. 

DUMBLEDORE 
This vial contains a most 
particular memory -- of the day I first met him. I’d like you to see it. If you would... 

Dumbledore extends his ashen hand and Harry rises,
gingerly takes the vial and removes the cork. He tips the contents into the Pensieve. Dumbledore nods and 
Harry leans into the iridescent liquid, his face breaking the surface... 

FLASHBACK - EXT. STREET (LONDON) - DAY (YEARS PAST) 46 

A horse-drawn MILK CART rattles across a RAIN-SWEPT * 
London street and a YOUNG DUMBLEDORE appears in a PLUM VELVET SUIT. We TRACK him down the street (and see him eye a LOVELY LASS appreciatively) until he reaches a GRIM BUILDING surrounded by IRON GATES. As Dumbledore passes through, CAMERA RISES: 

W O O L’ S O R P H A N A G E 

The IMAGE SHUDDERS and we -


CUT TO: 




47 INT. ORPHANAGE - CORRIDOR - PENSIEVE - DAY 47 
A skinny, sharp-featured woman, MRS. COLE, leads Dumbledore down a drab corridor. CHILDREN’S VOICES carry from an unseen COURTYARD, splashing and shrieking, in the 
midst of some game. 
* 
MRS. COLE 
I must confess to a bit of 
confusion upon receiving your letter, Mr. Dumbledore. In all 
the years Tom’s been here, he’s never once had a family visitor.
Frankly, I was stunned to find that someone knew of his 
existence. 
DUMBLEDORE 
I am not family. But his name has 
been known to me since birth. 
I see... 
MRS. COLE 
But she doesn’t really. She stops, frowns. 
MRS. COLE 
I think I should tell you. He’s a 
funny boy -- Tom. Odd. There 
have been incidents with the other 
children. Nasty things. 

DUMBLEDORE 
Perhaps you could give me an example. 
Mrs. Cole starts to speak, then shakes her head, moves off. As Dumbledore makes to follow, his eyes happen upon 
a FRAMED PHOTOGRAPH on the wall, old and yellowing,
depicting a SEASIDE SCENE of a SHARP ROCK OUTCROPPING and 
a CAVE. As he exits, we HOLD ON it. 
NEW ANGLE - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE TOM RIDDLE’S ROOM 
Mrs. Cole’s hand appears. KNOCKS. She turns the KNOB. 

48 INT. ORPHANAGE - RIDDLE’S ROOM - PENSIEVE - DAY 48 
A small room, grim and shadowy. TOM RIDDLE, 11 years old, sits atop a bed, hands in lap. The walls CRAWL with 
REFLECTED RAIN, oozing like oil down a grimy window. 









MRS. COLE 
You’ve got a visitor, Tom. 






Dumbledore steps forward, extends his hand. 

DUMBLEDORE 
How do you do, Tom. 

Riddle eyes Dumbledore briefly, looks away. 

MRS. COLE 
Well, I’ll leave you two to yourselves. 

Mrs. Cole exits, closing the door. Dumbledore studies 
Riddle, then begins to tour the room. Carefully placed upon a low shelf are some ODD SOUVENIRS. A grouping ofSEVEN STONES... A book containing SEVEN MATCHES. SEVEN 
BRASS KEYS... 

Moving on, Dumbledore passes a TALL CABINET, tracing hisFINGERS over its surface, as if the wood’s grain wereBraille, as if somehow “seeing” what lies within. 

Then Dumbledore pauses. Strewn on a small table are a 
grouping of SEVEN DARK DRAWINGS. A BOY and GIRL, their 
faces anguished. A sea-swept CAVE. The same cave from 
the photograph. Dumbledore begins to reach out... 

TOM RIDDLE 
Don’t. 

Dumbledore stops, turns. Finds Riddle’s level gaze on him. 

DUMBLEDORE 
As you wish. 

Riddle looks away and Dumbledore, for the first time,
notices his hands. They are splayed, utterly still, andINTERLACED with a SILKY WEB, where a SPIDER knits back 
and forth. 

TOM RIDDLE 
You’re the doctor, aren’t you? 

DUMBLEDORE 
No. I am a Professor. 

TOM RIDDLE 
I don’t believe you. I hear Mrs. 
Cole talking, her and the rest of the staff. They want me looked 
at. They think I’m different. 

DUMBLEDORE 
Perhaps they’re right. 






TOM RIDDLE 
I’m not mad. 

DUMBLEDORE 
Hogwarts is not a place for mad 
people. 

Riddle looks up, cocks his head ever-so-slightly. 

DUMBLEDORE 
It’s a school. A school of... 
magic. 

Riddle stays looking, but says nothing. 

DUMBLEDORE 
You can do things, can’t you, Tom?
Things the other children can’t. 

Riddle eyes Dumbledore intensely, unblinking. 

TOM RIDDLE 
Yes. 

DUMBLEDORE 
Tell me some of the things you cando, Tom. 

TOM RIDDLE 

(watching the spider)
I can make things move -- without touching them. I can make animals 
do what I want without training them. I can make bad things happen to people who are mean to 
me. I can make them hurt... if I 
want. 

Dumbledore studies Riddle -- then the boy looks up. 

TOM RIDDLE 
Who are you? 

DUMBLEDORE 
I’m like you, Tom. Different. 

Riddle closes his hands and the web collapses. 

TOM RIDDLE 
Prove it. 

It is not a request. Without breaking his gaze,
Dumbledore’s eyes narrow ever-so-slightly and... the WARDROBE BURSTS INTO FLAMES. Riddle wheels. 







Slowly smiles. Dumbledore studies him. Abruptly, the wardrobe begins to SHAKE. Riddle’s smile fades. 






DUMBLEDORE 
I think there is something trying to get out of your wardrobe, Tom.
Open it. Open. It. 

Terrified, Riddle steps to the burning wardrobe andt hrows open the door. On the topmost shelf, above a rail of threadbare clothes, a SMALL BOX SHAKES VIOLENTLY. 

DUMBLEDORE 
Take it out. 

As Riddle’s fingers touch the box, the flames engulfing the wardrobe vanish, but the box continues to SHAKE --
the only sound in the now-silent room. 

DUMBLEDORE 
Is there anything in that box you ought not to have? 

Riddle eyes Dumbledore, a trifle fearfully this time. He 
spills the box onto the bed: a YO-YO, a silver THIMBLE, 
and a tarnished MOUTH ORGAN. 

DUMBLEDORE 
Why did you want these things,
Tom? 

TOM RIDDLE 

(looking off)
I like having things that belonged to other people. It makes me feel 
... close to them. 

Dumbledore studies Riddle’s profile, pondering this. 

DUMBLEDORE 
Thievery is not tolerated at Hogwarts. At Hogwarts, you will be taught not only how to use 
magic, but to control it.
Understood? 

(as Riddle nods)
I’ll be going now, Tom. Leave 
your window open tonight. An owl 
will bring you a message. Read it 
carefully. 

Dumbledore starts to exit, when: 

TOM RIDDLE 
I can speak to snakes too. 

Dumbledore stops and we are ON his face, his back to Riddle. 






TOM RIDDLE 
They find me. Whisper things. Is 
that normal. For someone like me? 

DUMBLEDORE 
It is unusual. But not unheard 
of. 

Dumbledore exits then, without a backward glance, leaving11-year-old Tom Riddle alone. The IMAGE SHUDDERS and... 

49 INT. DUMBLEDORE’S OFFICE - NIGHT (PRESENT) 49 

... Harry and Dumbledore reappear. The room has grownDIM in their absence. Dumbledore gestures. LAMPS BLAZE 
to LIFE. 

HARRY 
Did you know, sir? Then? 

DUMBLEDORE 
Did I know that I had just met the most dangerous Dark Wizard of all time? No. Had I... 

Dumbledore falters, his expression troubled. Harry looks up from the Pensieve, where young Tom Riddle’s fragmented face floats on the surface, eyes Dumbledore. 

DUMBLEDORE 
Over time, while here at Hogwarts,
Tom Riddle grew close to one particular teacher. Can you guess which teacher that might be? 

HARRY 
You didn’t bring ProfessorSlughorn back simply to teachPotions, did you, sir? 

DUMBLEDORE 
No. I did not. You see, 
Professor Slughorn possesses something I desire very dearly.
And he will not part with it easily...

(eyeing Harry

knowingly)
I’d rather not divulge any more just yet, Harry. But I promise.
In time you will know everything. 






HARRY 

You said Professor Slughorn would

try to collect me. 

DUMBLEDORE 
I did. 

HARRY 
Do you want me to let him? 

Dumbledore trails his ashen fingers in the surface of the Pensieve, vanquishing young Tom Riddle’s face. 

DUMBLEDORE 
Yes. 

50 EXT. QUIDDITCH PITCH - MORNING 50 

Harry tries -- with little success -- to get the attention of the throng of aspiring Quidditch players assembled on the pitch. 

HARRY 

All right! Queue up! Excuse 

me... 

GINNY 
SHUT IT! 

Instant silence. Harry frowns, nods to Ginny nevertheless. 

HARRY 

Thanks. All right. This morning

I’ll be putting you all through a

few drills to assess your

strengths. But know this: Just 

because you made the team last

year does not guarantee you a spot

this year. Is that clear? 

Ron looks unnerved at this, sweating so much he’s attracted a PESKY FLY. CORMAC McLAGGEN, the huge boy from Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes, sidles up. 

CORMAC 

No hard feelings, Weasley,

alright? 

RON 
Hard feelings? 






CORMAC 
I’ll be going out for Keeper as well. Nothing personal. 

RON 
Really? Strapping guy like you,
you’ve got a Beater’s build, don’t you think? Keeper needs to be agile, quick --

Cormac nabs the FLY between two fingers, kills the BUZZ. 

CORMAC 
I like my chances. Say... think you could introduce me to your friend Granger? Wouldn’t mind 
getting on a first name basis,
know what I mean? 

Cormac gives a lewd wink, saunters off. Ron glances up to the stands. Hermione smiles, waves. 

BEGIN MONTAGE 

Ginny flies swiftly, handling the Quaffle with ease. 

TWO SECOND YEARS collide in mid-air. 

Cormac makes a brilliant save. 

Ron makes a shaky save. 

Hermione looks on, nervous for him. 

Katie Bell snatches a Quaffle with one hand, splits two defenders beautifully and makes a slick blind pass to 
Dean who jets high in the air, then lets the Quaffle rolloff his fingers... right into Ginny’s hands as she races below. 

Seamus sends a Bludger rocketing into the stands,
scatters a group of onlookers, leaving only Neville, who sidles delicately to the right as the others leg it. 

TWO THIRD YEARS collide in mid-air. 

Cormac makes a brilliant save. 

Ron turns the wrong way but makes the save anyway as the Quaffle caroms off the tail of his broom. 

Hermione looks on more nervously. 







DEMELZA ROBINS, bent low over her stick, pins the Quaffle under her chin, splits two Bludgers and a pair of Beaters. 






TWO FOURTH YEARS collide in mid-air. 

Two aspiring Beaters “whiff” on a pair of Bludgers, whack each other instead and plummet to the pitch as the Bludgers ricochet off one another and go flying into the stands, scattering onlookers yet again and leaving, as before, only Neville. This time, he sidles delicately to the left. 

Cormac makes a brilliant save. 

The Quaffle bounces off Ron’s head. 

Hermione looks on extremely nervously. 

TWO FIFTH YEARS collide in mid-air. 

END MONTAGE. 

ANOTHER ANGLE 

The survivors press ICE PACKS to their heads, run TAPE round twisted fingers. Only Ron, hovering at the west goal, and Cormac, hovering at the east, remain on the pitch. Luna, Spectrespecs in place, eyes Cormac -- cool,
confident, clear. Then eyes Ron -- sweaty, nervous,
SWARMING in WRACKSPURTS. 

HARRY 
All right. Cormac. Ron. It’s 
down to you two for Keeper. We’ll 
decide it with a shootout. 
Demelza, you’ll bring the Quaffle up against Cormac. Ginny, you’ll take on Ron. 

CORMAC 
Hang on. She’s his sister. How 
do I know she won’t toss him a 
floater? 

GINNY 
Piss off, Cormac. How ‘bout I 
toss you a floater? 

HARRY 
Quiet! I’m Captain. We do it my 
way. Now line up. On three. 
One. Two... Three! 

Demelza and Ginny rocket forth. Ron weaves nervously while Cormac hovers in place, a confident sneer on his face. 






HARRY 
(under his breath)
C’mon, Ron... 

Demelza hunkers over her broom once again, flying like a narrow, then goes into a wide, sweeping slide. Ginny blasts over the pitch, ginger hair streaming like flames,
then rolls recklessly to the side. As one, they both let fly... 

Hermione, face buried in her fingers, MUTTERS SOMETHING. 

Cormac, at the last moment, inexplicably rolls his broom to the right and the Quaffle sails over his shoulder.
Ron, zig-zagging crazily, nearly falls off, rights himself in a panic, and deflects Ginny’s Quaffle... with his forehead. As a few partisan CHEERS erupt from the stands, Harry grins, then has to restrain himself.
Hermione opens her eyes slowly. 

LAVENDER BROWN 
Isn’t he brilliant? 

Hermione stares balefully at Lavender, then notices Cormac eyeing his broom incredulously. She gets up,
slips away. 

51 INT. COMMON ROOM - NIGHT 51 

Harry scans his Potions book. Hermione peruses the 
Prophet. Ron cracks walnuts, pitching the pieces into the fire. 

RON 

Have to admit, thought I was going

to miss that last one. Hope

Cormac’s not taking it too hard. 

Behind her paper, Hermione rolls her eyes. 

RON 

Has a bit of a thing for you,

Hermione. Cormac. 

HERMIONE 
He’s vile. 

Ron considers this, then glances across the room atLavender. 

HARRY 
Ever heard of this spell? 






Harry points to a notation in the margin underlined three times: “Sectumsempra. For Enemies.” Hermione frowns. 

HERMIONE 
No I have not. And if you had a shred of self-respect you would turn that book in. 

RON 
Not bloody likely. He’s top of the class. Even better than you,
Hermione. Slughorn thinks he’s a genius. 

Hermione casts Ron a withering glance. 

RON 
What? 

HERMIONE 
I’d like to know just whose book that was. Let’s take a look, 
shall we? 

HARRY 
(holding it out of reach)
No. 

HERMIONE 
(suspicious)
Why not? 

HARRY 
It’s... old. The binding is fragile. 

HERMIONE 

The binding is fragile? 

She makes another grab for it, but Harry holds it clear.
Then Ginny appears, plucks it out of his hand. 

GINNY 
Who’s the Half-Blood Prince? 

HERMIONE/RONThe who? 

GINNY 
That’s what it says. Right here. 

‘This Book is the Property of theHalf-Blood Prince.’ 




51 


51. 
51 
Ginny points. Written on the frontispiece is: “This 
Book is the Property of the Half-Blood Prince.” 
52 EXT. MAIN STREET (HOGSMEADE VILLAGE) - DAY 52 
Students lean into a bitter wind, trudging through deep 
snow. 

HERMIONE 
For weeks you carry around this book, practically sleep with it... 
and you have no desire to find out who The Half-Blood Prince is? 

HARRY 
I didn’t say I wasn’t curious. 
And, by the way, I don’t sleep with it. 

RON 
(a sarcastic chortle)
Yeah. Right.
(as Harry glares)
Well, it’s true. I like a nice 
chat before I go to bed. Now 
you’re always reading that bloody book. It’s like being with Hermione. 
This time it’s Hermione’s turn to glare. 
HERMIONE 
Well, I was curious. So I went 
to -The 
library. 
HARRY/RON 
And? 
HARRY 
HERMIONE 
And... nothing. There’s no 
reference to the Half-Blood Prince 
anywhere. 
Good. 
HARRY 
That settles it then. 
Hermione starts to object, when: 
HAGRID 
Hey, you three! 






HAGRID emerges out of the trees, beard crusted in white,
looking like a crazed Father Christmas. Behind him, deep in the woods, DARK SILHOUETTES --AURORS -- can be seen. 
Hermione eyes them briefly, then nods to the PULSATING BURLAP BAG Hagrid clutches in his fist. 

HERMIONE 
What’ve you got there, Hagrid? 

Hagrid tips open the bag. The trio grimace. Hagrid CHUCKLES. 

HAGRID 
Stinksap. Burn the whiskers right off yer chin. Trees ‘ere are 
drippin’ with it. 

HERMIONE 
Stinksap? You’re not sick, are 
you? 

HAGRID 
It’s not fer me. It’s fer Aragog.
Yeh remember Aragog, don’ yeh? 

RON 
Spider? About six feet tall? Ten 
feet wide? 

HAGRID 
Tha’s the one. He’s taken ill. 
I’m hopin’ ter nurse ‘im back.
Keep yer fingers crossed. 

Hagrid crosses his fingers. Ron forces a grin, does the same, shakes his head as Hagrid disappears back into the 
trees. 

RON 
Barking. Does he not remember 
that raving arachnid tried to eat us? What? 

Ron sees Hermione staring at the Aurors again. 

HERMIONE 
The Aurors. I know they’re here to protect us, but... somehow I don’t feel any safer. 

Just then Harry spies Slughorn, heading down towards the Village, passing a weary Flitwick coming the other way. 







SLUGHORN 

Filius! I was hoping to find you

at the Three Broomsticks. 

FLITWICK 

Emergency choir practice, I’m

afraid, Horace. 

Harry watches Slughorn continue on toward the Village. 






HARRY 
Who’s up for a Butterbeer? 

53 INT. THREE BROOMSTICKS - DAY (LATER) 53 

As the trio enter, Harry glances round, locates Slughorn at the bar, planted plumply on a stool. 

HARRY 
No. Over here. 

Hermione and Ron, in the midst of seating themselves at a perfectly acceptable -- and clean -- table, see Harry seat himself at one strewn with the detritus of a 
previous customer -- but which puts him in direct view ofSlughorn. They exchange a glance, shrug, join Harry.
Ron starts to take the chair directly opposite Harry --
blocking his view. 

HARRY 
No, no. Sit next to me. 

Ron stops, exchanges another glance with Hermione. 

RON 
O-kay. 

A SKINNY KID in an apron appears, tosses a FILTHY RAG upon the table -- which begins to wipe the surface on its 
own. Harry cranes his neck around the kid to keepSlughorn in view. 

SKINNY KID 
What’ll we have? 

HERMIONE 

Three Butterbeers. Splash of

ginger in mine, please. 

The kid WHISTLES and the rag leaps back into his pocket.
Harry continues to eye Slughorn, when he sees Draco.
They lock eyes briefly, then Draco exits. 

RON 
Aw, bloody hell... 

Harry turns, sees Ron glowering at Ginny, who sits in a dark corner with Dean, their faces lit by a guttering candle. 

HERMIONE 

Oh, honestly, Ronald. They’re

just holding hands...

(MORE) 






HERMIONE (CONT'D) 
(as Dean kisses Ginny)
And snogging. 

HERMIONE (CONT'D) 
(as Dean kisses Ginny)
And snogging. 

RON 
I’d like to leave. 

HERMIONE 
Leave? You can’t be serious. 

RON 
That happens to be my sister. 

HERMIONE 
So? What if she looked over here 
and saw you snogging me? Would 
you expect her to get up and 
leave? 

Ron blinks, utterly speechless. Then: 

SLUGHORN 

Harry, m’boy! 

Slughorn’s voice BOOMS so loudly even Ginny jumps -- and catches Harry looking. As Slughorn waddles over,
SLOSHING mug in hand, Harry rises immediately -- an action so grossly out of character that Hermione regards him with amused curiosity. 

HARRY 
Hello, sir. Wonderful to see you. 

Hermione, brow wrinkling, turns to Ron, silently mouths:
wonderful to see you? 

HARRY 
So what brings you here, sir? 

SLUGHORN 
Oh, the Three Broomsticks and I go way back. Longer than I’d care to admit. In fact, I remember when 
it was simply One Broomstick! 

As Slughorn GUFFAWS, Harry joins in, LAUGHING HEARTILY as well. Slughorn’s belly trembles next to Hermione’s cheek 
and his waving mug sloshes over, spattering the table. 

SLUGHORN 
Oops! All hands on deck, Granger! 

Hermione smiles thinly, when a WHISTLE is heard and the FILTHY RAG is back, whisking away Slughorn’s mess as theSKINNY KID slides three foaming mugs onto the table. 






(In the b.g. Katie Bell emerges from the back, starts for the exit. Her friend LEANNE follows her out.) 

SLUGHORN 
Listen, m’boy. In the old days, I used to throw together the occasional supper and invite a select student or two. Would you be game? 

HARRY 
I’d consider it an honor, sir. 

SLUGHORN 
You’d be welcome too, Granger. 

Hermione, in the midst of emptying her Butterbeer in one long draw, SLAMS down her mug -- leaving behind a“mustache.” 

HERMIONE 
Be delighted, sir. 

SLUGHORN 
Brilliant. Look for my owl.
(exiting, to Ron)
Good to see you, Wallenby. 

Ron frowns as Slughorn waddles away, turns to Harry. 

RON 
What’re you playing at? 

HARRY 
Dumbledore asked me to... get to know him. 

RON 

Get to know him? 

HARRY 
Dunno. But it must be important.
Otherwise Dumbledore wouldn’t ask. 

Slam! Ron turns, sees that Hermione has emptied his mug as well. Ron gestures to her upper lip. 

RON 
Um... You’ve got a little... 

Without a thought, she flicks her tongue up, wipes it clean. 




54 EXT. ROAD (OUTSIDE HOGSMEADE) - DAY (MOMENTS LATER) 54 

The snow falls heavily now. Ron and Harry walk together,
while Hermione trails several yards behind, pirouetting happily, letting snowflakes fall on her tongue. 

RON 

Bit worried about her. Did you

hear that rubbish she was talking

back in the pub? Her and me 

snogging. Ha. As if... 

LEANNE (O.S.)

Katie. You don’t know what it 

could be! 

Up ahead, Katie Bell and Leanne stand in the drifting snow, ARGUING. Katie holds a SLENDER PACKAGE. Hermione 
comes bumping up, drapes her arms over the boys. 

HERMIONE 
What’s up? 

At that very instant, Katie Bell RISES SIX FEET INTO THE AIR. Hair dancing violently in the wind, her face remains eerily placid. Then she... SCREAMS. Harry and Ron DASH FORWARD, seize her ankles. At their touch, she 
FALLS to the snow, THRASHING and SHRIEKING, EYES ROLLED 
UP in her skull. 

LEANNE 

I warned her! I warned her not to 

touch it! 

Hermione looks. Lying in the snow is the PACKAGE, TORN. 

RON 

Harry, she’s swallowing her 

tongue --

HERMIONE 
I’ll get someone --

HARRY 
There’s no time! 

Suddenly, a MASSIVE FIGURE LURCHES out of the WHITE:
Hagrid. 

HAGRID 
Get back! All o’ yeh! 






He says this so forcefully the others instantly obey.
Effortlessly, he scoops up Katie’s thrashing body and then, as if calming a terrified animal, presses his face close to hers and WHISPERS with great TENDERNESS: 

HAGRID 
Now, now. Now, now... 

Over and over he repeats this, soothingly, the words like a mantra, until Katie’s lids flutter and her body goes limp. 

HAGRID 

Don’ go touchin’ tha’ but by the

wrappin’s. Unnerstan’? 

Hagrid nods darkly to the package in the snow. Harry kneels. Poking through the paper is an ORNATE OPAL NECKLACE. Taking off his scarf he carefully enfolds package and rises. Then, along with the others, he watches Hagrid lumber off, Katie cradled in his arms. In 
seconds they are swallowed by the snow. The only sound is the ROAR of the WIND. 

55 INT. McGONAGALL’S OFFICE - LATER (LATE AFTERNOON) 55 

The necklace lies green and glittering upon McGonagall’s desk. 

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL 

You’re sure Katie did not have 

this in her possession when she

entered the Three Broomsticks, 

Leanne? 

LEANNE 

It’s like I said. She went to the 

loo and when she came back she had 

the package. She said it was 

important she deliver it. 

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL 
Did she say to whom? 

Leanne shakes her head. 

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL 
All right, Leanne. You may go.

(as Leanne exits)

Why is it always you three? Hm? 

When something happens? 






RON 

Believe me, Professor, I’ve been 

asking myself the same question

for six years. 

Just then, Snape appears at the door, eyes the trio. 

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL 
Severus. 

SNAPE 
Is this it? 

McGonagall nods. Snape takes his wand, lifts the necklace like a dead snake. Eyes it with fascination. 

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL 
What do you think? 

SNAPE 

I think Miss Bell is lucky to be

alive. 

HARRY 

She was cursed, wasn’t she? I 

know Katie. Off the Quidditch 

pitch she wouldn’t hurt a fly. If 

she was bringing that to someone, 

she wasn’t doing it knowingly. 

Snape eyes Harry levelly. 

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL 
Yes. She was cursed. 

HARRY 
It was Malfoy. 

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL 

That’s a very serious accusation,

Potter. 

SNAPE 
Indeed. Your evidence? 

HARRY 
I... just... know. 

SNAPE 

You... just... know. Once again

you astonish with your gifts,

Potter, gifts mere mortals could

only dream of possessing. How 

grand it must be to be the Chosen

One. 




55 


59. 
55 
Ron and Hermione avert their eyes uncomfortably. 
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL 
I suggest you return to your dormitory. All of you. 
56 INT. BOYS’ DORMITORY (GRYFFINDOR TOWER) - NIGHT 56 
Harry and Ron lie awake in the darkened dormitory.
stares at the ceiling. Harry eyes “Malfoy” on theMarauder’s Map. 
Ron 
RON 
What do you suppose Dean sees in her? Ginny. 
HARRY 
What does she see in him? 
Dean? 
RON 
He’s brilliant. 
HARRY 
You called him a slick git not 
five hours ago. 
RON 
Yeah, well, he was running his hands all over my sister, wasn’t he? Something snaps. You’ve got to hate him. You know, on 
principle. 
HARRY 
(troubled by this)
I suppose. 
RON 
So what is it? He sees in her? 
HARRY 
I don’t know. She’s smart. 
Funny. Attractive... 
Attractive? 
RON 
You know. 
HARRY 
She’s... got nice skin. 
RON 
Skin? You’re saying Dean’s dating my sister because of her skin? 






HARRY 
Well, no. I mean... I’m just saying it could be a contributing factor. 

Silence. Then: 

RON 
Hermione’s got nice skin.
Wouldn’t you say? As skin goes, I 
mean. 

HARRY 
I’ve never really thought about it. But I suppose, yeah. Very nice. 

Another silence. Suddenly it feels weird. 

HARRY 
I think I’ll be going to sleep 
now. 

RON 
Right. 

Harry sets the Map aside. We HOLD. Malfoy’s DOT moves down the 7th Floor corridor... and disappears. 

SLUGHORN (V.O.) 

A toast! 

57 INT. SLUGHORN’S OFFICE - NIGHT 57 

Slughorn stands at the head of a table, goblet raised to the students seated before him, which in addition to 
Harry and Hermione include MARCUS BELBY, Blaise Zabini,
NEVILLE LONGBOTTOM and the TWINS. A distinctive CRYSTAL 
HOURGLASS sits in the center of the table. 

SLUGHORN 
To Hogwarts’ best and brightest! 

CORMAC 
Here, here! 

Hermione exchanges a wry glance with Harry, who notices that ONE SETTING is EMPTY. The twins make -- and drink --
their toast in perfect unison. Neville stares hopelessly at the vast array of forks, knives and spoons placed beside his plate. 

NEVILLE 
Which one do I use for the soup? 







Hermione grins, looks up, and gets a WINK from Cormac. 

CUT TO: 

SAME SCENE - LATER 

SLUGHORN 
So tell me, Cormac. See much of 
your Uncle Tiberius these days? 

CORMAC 
Yes, sir. In fact, I’m meant to 
go hunting with him and theMinister for Magic over holiday. 

SLUGHORN 
Well, be sure to give them both my best. What about your uncle, 
Belby? Working on anything new?

(to the others)
For those of you who don’t know,
Marcus’ uncle invented the 
Wolfsbane Potion. 

As he speaks, Belby never once looks up from his plate. 

MARCUS BELBY 
Dunno. He and me dad don’t get 
on. Probably because Dad thinks potions are rubbish. Says the only potion worth having is a stiff one at the end of the -


(day.) 

SLUGHORN 
And you, Miss Granger? What is it 
your family does in the Muggle world? 

HERMIONE 
My parents are dentists. They tend to people’s teeth. 

SLUGHORN 
Fascinating. And is that 
considered a dangerous profession? 

HERMIONE 
No. Though, a boy named Robbie Fenwick did bite my father once.
Needed ten stitches. 

As Slughorn nods, the door GROANS. Everyone turns. 










SLUGHORN 
Miss Weasley! Come in, come in. 

GINNY 
Sorry, I’m not ordinarily late --

She falters, eyes red, uncharacteristically flustered. 






SLUGHORN 

No matter. You’ll be just in time

for dessert. That is -- if Belby

leaves you any. 

As Ginny moves to her seat, Hermione WHISPERS to Harry. 

HERMIONE 

Look at her eyes. They’ve been

fighting again. Her and Dean. 

Harry nods, then stands as Ginny reaches the table -- the only one. Hermione notices, eyes him with amusement as he sits. 

HARRY 
What? 

HERMIONE 
Nothing. 

As Hermione smiles, she lightly strokes the crystal hourglass with a finger and we --

DISSOLVE TO: 

58 INT. SLUGHORN’S OFFICE - NIGHT (LATER) 58 

... LATER, the sand having run out with the evening. 
Slughorn says his goodbyes. 

SLUGHORN 

Thank you, one and all, for a most

stimulating evening. We’ll have 

to do it again. 

Slughorn closes the door, turns, sends a FLOOR LAMP WOBBLING and, catching it, finds Harry. 

SLUGHORN 
Oh. Potter. 

HARRY 

Sorry, sir, I was just admiring

your hourglass. 

SLUGHORN 

Ah, yes. A most intriguing

object. The sands run in 

accordance to the quality of the

conversation. When it is 

stimulating, the sands run slow.

When it is not... 







HARRY 
I think I’ll be going. 

SLUGHORN 
Nonsense. You have nothing to fear, m’boy. As for some of your classmates, well, let’s just say,
they’re unlikely to make the shelf. 

Slughorn steps to a makeshift bar, begins to construct a drink. 

HARRY 
The shelf, sir? 

Slughorn gestures to the PHOTOGRAPHS seen earlier, now ranged like a menagerie atop a low bookcase. Once again,
Lily Potter and Regulus Black up front. 

SLUGHORN 
Anyone who aspires to be anyone hopes to end up here. Then * 
again... you are already someone aren’t you, Harry? 

HARRY 
I don’t really know how to answer that, sir. 

SLUGHORN 
Your mother was modest too. Your 
father not so much. As you can see, he did not make the shelf. 

Slughorn smiles genially, turns back to his drink, using a pair of TONGS to drop ice into his glass. 

HARRY 
Did Voldemort ever make the shelf, 
sir? 

Slughorn stiffens, his back to Harry. His hand trembles 
and the ice slips from the tongs. Harry notices. 

HARRY 
You knew him, didn’t you, sir?
Tom Riddle. You were his teacher. 

SLUGHORN 
Mr. Riddle had many teachers while here at Hogwarts. 

HARRY 
What was he like? 






Harry can see the vein in Slughorn’s temple pulsating.
Fearing he may have overstepped... 

HARRY 

I’m sorry, sir. Forgive me. He 

killed my parents, you see... 

Harry stops, frowns. Slughorn turns, studies Harry.
Nods. 

SLUGHORN 

Of course. It’s only natural that

you should want to know more. I’m 

afraid I must disappoint you,

Harry. When I first met young Mr.

Riddle, he was simply a quiet,

albeit brilliant, boy committed to

becoming a first-rate wizard. Not 

unlike the others I’ve known. In 

fact, not unlike... you. If the 

monster existed, it was buried 

deep within. 

CLOSE ON THE HOURGLASS 

Nary a grain trickles through. 

59 INT. GREAT HALL - MORNING 59 

Ron enters the Hall, eyes lowered, knuckles taped forQuidditch, flexing his fingers anxiously as he makes for the Gryffindor table. Neville passes going the other 
way. 

NEVILLE 
Good luck, eh, Ron? 

Ron nods shortly, then Seamus comes up on his side,
WHISPERS CONSPIRATORIALLY. 

SEAMUS 

Counting on you, Ron. I’ve two 

Galleons on Gryffindor. 

As Seamus peels off, Ron cuts his eyes toward the Slytherin table, where the Quidditch team sits together.
One Slytherin juts his chin toward Ron, MUTTERS something. A few turn, snigger. Ron averts his eyes and... almost runs into Cormac, who eyes him with disdain as he passes. Frowning, Ron drops down opposite Harry and Hermione. Harry eyes him briefly, knowingly, pushes a plate across. Ron takes a fork, pokes at it glumly. 







RON 
So. How was it? 

Hermione continues to read the Prophet, unaware of Ron’s 
mood. 

HERMIONE 
How was what? 

RON 
(with mock refinement)
Your dinner party. 

HERMIONE 
Dead boring. Though I think Harry enjoyed dessert. 






Harry’s eyes shift, find Hermione smiling faintly from behind the Prophet. 

HERMIONE 
Ol’ Sluggy’s having a Christmas do, you know. And we’re meant to 
bring someone... 

RON 
I expect you’ll be going with McLaggen. Isn’t he a member of 
the Slug Club? 

HERMIONE 
Actually, I was going to ask you. 

RON 
Really? 

HERMIONE 
Really. But seeing as you have such a distaste for the idea -


LAVENDER BROWN 

(passing by)
Good luck today, Ron! I know 
you’ll be brilliant! 

Ron smiles feebly, looks back down at his plate.
Hermione stares daggers. 

RON 
I’m resigning. After today’s match. McLaggen can have my spot. 

Hearing this, Hermione turns back. Harry catches her eye, extends a SHAKING HAND to indicate Ron’s mental 
state. 

HARRY 
Have it your way. Juice? 

Hermione blinks, surprised by Harry’s callousness. Ron 
is surprised as well -- and mildly put out. 

RON 
Sure... 

As Harry pours, Luna arrives at the table wearing a HAT that bears an uncanny resemblance to a real lion. 

LUNA 
Hello, everyone. You look 
dreadful, Ron. 







Ron nods grimly, lifts his glass. Luna turns to Harry. 






LUNA 

Is that why you just put something

in his cup. Is it a tonic? 

The tiny vial of Felix Felicis glints in Harry’s palm. 

HERMIONE 
Don’t drink that, Ron! 

But Ron’s frozen in mid-sip, looking at Harry’s palm too.
Quickly, he gulps down the rest. 

HERMIONE 
You could be expelled for that. 

HARRY 
Dunno what you’re talking about. 

Harry pockets the vial, winks at Luna. Ron rises. 

RON 

C’mon, Harry. We’ve got a game to

win. 

CLOSEUP - QUAFFLE 

As it ROCKETS into the AIR... 

60 EXT. QUIDDITCH PITCH - DAY 60 

Instantly, Slytherin snatches the Quaffle and rushes en masse toward Gryffindor’s end, weaving and passing with wicked skill, culminating in a vicious, slicing shot on goal. Just when it appears it will clear the hoop, Ron streaks out of nowhere and sends the Quaffle screaming in the opposite direction. Ginny pauses on her broom,
stunned. 

GINNY 
What’s gotten into him? 

She glances up at Harry, circling high above and he grins. Just then, Dean streaks by: 

DEAN 
Ginny! Let’s go! 

Instantly, she rolls backward, jets off and races down her fellow Chasers. Flying in spread formation, Dean --
on the far wing -- starts the Quaffle “up the line” until it lands in Ginny’s hand. 






Pitching herself into a wide slide to avoid a PAIR ofWHISTLING BLUDGERS, she leans recklessly off her broom and whips the Quaffle through the goal untouched. 

As the CROWD SCREAMS, Harry eyes the Gryffindor section,
where Luna’s LION HAT ROARS, Lavender CLAPS for Ron and 
Hermione sits with her arms crossed, a look of supreme annoyance on her face. Harry grins, jets off. 

61 INT. GRYFFINDOR COMMON ROOM - NIGHT 61 

The room teems with students celebrating Gryffindor’s victory. It feels like Mardi Gras. Or a mosh pit. Or a 
riot. And Ron is right smack in the middle of it. 

CROWD 

Weasley! Weasley! Weasley! 

Harry takes his backslaps on the periphery, smiling as he sips a Butterbeer and enjoys Ron’s turn in the spotlight. 

HERMIONE 
Ron seems to be enjoying himself. 

HARRY 
Yep. Apparently it’s his lucky day. 

HERMIONE 
You shouldn’t have done it, Harry. 

HARRY 
Yeah. I suppose I could’ve just used, I dunno... a Confundus 
charm? 

HERMIONE 

(caught)
That was different. It was 
tryouts. This was an actual 
match -


She stops. Harry dangles the vial. The SEALING WAX is 
UNBROKEN, the bottle full. 

HERMIONE 
You didn’t put it in?
(as he shakes his head)
Ron only thought you did? 

He nods. She POPS him playfully on the arm when WHISTLESand CATCALLS rise. They turn to see what the commotion is about and find, smack dab in the center of the room... 






Ron and Lavender. In a clinch. Kissing. Harry stares,
blinks, then turns back... to no one. His eyes shift,
track Hermione as she bumps through the crowd toward the portrait hole. 

62 EXT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT (SECONDS LATER) 62 

Harry leaves the ROAR of the party for the QUIET of the corridor. Ahead, a door stands ajar. CHIRPING can be 
heard. 

63 INT. CHAMBER - SAME TIME - NIGHT 63 

Hermione sits atop a desk, a small ring of TWITTERING BIRDS circling her head. The birds change color as they orbit, from sunny yellow to a dark, angry scarlet. 

HERMIONE 
Charms spell. Just practicing. 

HARRY 
Ah. Well... they’re really good. 

HERMIONE 

(studying her wand)

How does it feel, Harry? When you

see Dean with Ginny?

(off his look)

I know, Harry. You’re my best

friend. I see how you look at

her. 

Just then the DOOR BURSTS WIDE and Ron rushes in, pulling a GIGGLING Lavender by the hand. They stop. Take 
inventory. 

LAVENDER BROWN 
Oops. I think this room’s taken. 

As Lavender pulls Ron out, he cuts his VOICE LOW to Harry. 

RON 
What’s with the birds? 

Before Harry can reply, Hermione rises, points her wand. 

HERMIONE 

Oppugno! 

Instantly the birds race like angry red bullets toward Ron, who flees, SLAMMING SHUT the door. 






As the birds hit the door, they EXPLODE SOFTLY into small FEATHER CLOUDS and Hermione covers her face and SOBS. 
Harry goes to her, hesitates, then tentatively drapes his arm over her. As she turns her face into his chest, he 
pulls her closer, watching as, across the room, the last scarlet feather drifts to the floor, joining the pool already there. 

HARRY 
It feels like this. 

64 EXT. CASTLE - WINDOW - SAME TIME - NIGHT 64 

THROUGH the icy window, we see Harry cradling Hermione within. As CAMERA DRIFTS AWAY, RISING THROUGH the 
FALLING SNOW, the VIEW EXPANDS. In the Common Room, the 
party rages on, while three windows down, Lavender pulls Ron into a kiss. Figures pass by windows, including one tall, pale boy standing at a WINDOW on the SEVENTH FLOOR:
Malfoy. As he turns away, the castle slides FROM VIEW and the CAMERA TILTS UP TO the sky, drifting with snow. 

65 INT. CORRIDOR - DAY 65 

Tinsel decks the banisters and mistletoe droops from the ceiling. As Ron and Harry make their way down the crowded corridor, passing the BIRDCAGE, Ron walks with anew air of confidence, not exactly strutting, but close. 

RON 

Look, I can’t help it if she’s got

her knickers in a twist. What Lav 

and I have -- well, let’s just say

there was no stopping it. It’s 

chemical. Will it last? Who 

knows? Point is, I’m a free 

agent. 

66 INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT 66 

Harry trails Hermione through the stacks. 

HERMIONE 

He’s at perfect liberty to kiss

whomever he likes. I really

couldn’t care less. Was I under 

the impression that he and I would

be attending Slughorn’s Christmas

party together? Yes. Of course, 

now, given the circumstances, I’ve

had to make other arrangements. 






HARRY 
Have you? 

HERMIONE 
Yes. Why? 

HARRY 
I just thought, you know, since neither one of us can take who 
we’d really like... maybe we’d go together. As friends. 

HERMIONE 
(stopping)
Why didn’t I think of that? 

HARRY 
So who are you taking? 

HERMIONE 

(evasively)
Um... it’s a surprise. Besides, 
it’s you we need to worry about.
And you can’t pick just anyone.
See that girl over there. That’s 
Romilda Vane. Rumor has it she’s 
trying to slip you a love potion. 

HARRY 
Really...? 

Harry considers a fine-boned GIRL with RAVEN HAIR(ROMILDA VANE). She is exquisite, an absolute work of... 

HERMIONE 

(snapping fingers) 
Hey! She’s only interested in you because she thinks you’re theChosen One. You know that, right? 

HARRY 
But I am the Chosen One. 

Hermione cocks her head at him, exasperated. 

HARRY 
Okay. Kidding. I’ll just ask someone I like. Someone cool. 




67 INT. STAIRCASE/CORRIDOR - NIGHT 
Luna Lovegood, decked out in a set of SPANGLED SILVER ROBES, and Harry, in basic black, make their way toward the STRAINS of CHRISTMAS MUSIC, RED LANTERNS lighting their way. 
LUNA 
I’ve never been to this part of the castle. At least not while 
awake. I sleepwalk, you see.
It’s why I wear shoes to bed. 
As Harry and Luna pass out of sight, we PICK UP Malfoy,
standing in the shadows of an alcove. He watches them 
go, then moves off. 
67 
68 INT. HOGWARTS CASTLE - ANOTHER CORRIDOR - SAME TIME -
NIGHT 
68 
In the f.g., the BIRDCAGE glimmers dully in the gray 
moonlight streaming through a window. Within, the TWO 
BIRDS huddle quietly. We RACK FOCUS and see, THROUGH the 
grid of wire, a FIGURE APPROACHING. 
Draco moves down the corridor, eyes fixed oddly ahead.
He looks pale in the moonlight. In his fist he grips an APPLE. As he passes the cage, we HOLD ON the BIRDS. 
69 INT. SEVENTH FLOOR CORRIDOR - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 
Draco approaches. Stops. Turns to the wall. Closes his 
eyes. 
69 
70 INT. ROOM OF REQUIREMENT - NIGHT (SECONDS LATER) 
CAMERA GLIDES PAST dozens of TOWERING SHELVES, dust-
strewn and listing like dominoes, cluttered with all matter of strange OBJECTS. Draco appears, his legs pushing him on, wending his way through the narrow 
passages. 
70 
NEW ANGLE - BEHIND LARGE RECTANGULAR MASS 
We RISE ABOVE it, watch Draco walk directly TOWARD us and 
stop. He stares at the solid mass before him. Reaches 
out and takes the fringe of the tapestry covering it.
Tugs. The tapestry shivers like water to the floor,
revealing... 
A CABINET, identical to the one in Borgin & Burkes. 






Draco runs a hand over the glossy finish, comes away with DUST upon his fingertips. Glancing around, he spies aBUST of a WOMAN wearing a TIARA, removes the SILK SCARF hanging from her porcelain neck and gently wipes the dust away from the cabinet. Bringing the apple up, he opens the cabinet and places it within. Shuts it. Closing his eyes, he MUTTERS a LOW INCANTATION, barely discernible. 

He reaches out. Opens it. The apple is gone. He closes 
the cabinet again. Waits. Longer this time. Finally,
he opens it. Removes the apple. Rotates it. 

Someone has taken a BITE out of it. 

71 INT. SLUGHORN’S OFFICE - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 71 

FLASH! A CAMERA POPS, reveals Harry smiling with Slughorn before a PHOTOGRAPHER (ADRIAN). The ceiling and walls are draped with HANGINGS of emerald, crimson and gold, so the room feels like a tent... or the inside of a gift box. It is LOUD and packed with people. 

SLUGHORN 
Thank you, Adrian! 

(quietly to Harry)

One of mine. Class of ‘78. I had 

hoped for more out of him, but at

least the pictures are in focus.

(suddenly)

Oh my! Excuse me, Harry. I must 

greet the new Minister of Magical

Transportation. Class of ‘67. 

(as he goes)

Mingle, m’boy! Mingle! We’re all 

friends here. And we run the 

world. 

Harry watches Slughorn make a beeline across the room,
along the way nodding to the twins, who have apparently come with each other. 

VOICE (O.S.)
Drink? 

Harry turns, finds Neville standing with a tray. 

HARRY 
Neville...? 

NEVILLE 

I didn’t make the cut for the Slug

Club. It’s okay. He’s got Belby

handing out towels in the loo. 






As Neville turns away, Harry notices a pair of GIRL’S FEET protruding from beneath a CRIMSON HANGING. His gaze rises, finds Hermione peeking out. As he moves off, we 
see Luna talking to a small, stout bespectacled man (ELDRED WORPLE). 

ELDRED WORPLE 
Lovegood, did you say? I once 
encountered a seriously unbalanced man by that name at a book signing. Claimed to run a 
magazine... 

NEW ANGLE - HERMIONE - BEHIND THE HANGING - SECONDS LATER 

HARRY (O.S.)
What’re you doing? 

Hermione YELPS, turns, pulls Harry behind the hanging.
Her hair is slightly askew, her lipstick a bit blurry. 

HARRY 
And what’s happened to you? 

HERMIONE 
Hm? Oh, I’ve just escaped -- I 
mean, left Cormac. Under the 
mistletoe. 

HARRY 
Cormac! That’s who you invited! 

HERMIONE 
I thought it would annoy Ron most.
But he’s a menace. He’s got more tentacles than a Snarfalump plant. 

WAITER (O.S.)
Dragon tartar? 

They turn, find a WAITER peeking in, tray in hand. 

HERMIONE 
No thank you. 

WAITER 
Just as well. They give one horribly bad breath. 

HERMIONE 

(grabbing the tray)
On second thought -- maybe it’ll keep Cormac at bay. Oh no, here 
he comes! 






Hermione pops two of the Dragon blobs into her mouth,
shoves the tray in Harry’s hand and flits away. 

NEW ANGLE - PARTY - SAME TIME 

Snape, looking bored, stands on the periphery of a conversation, when he sees Hermione exit one side of the 
hanging and Cormac enter the other. 

NEW ANGLE - BEHIND THE HANGING - SAME TIME 

HARRY 
I think she went to powder her 
nose. 

Harry looks past Cormac’s shoulder, out past the hanging and sees Slughorn laughing with a guest. Cormac plucks a dragon blob off the tray in Harry’s hand, pops it. 

CORMAC 
Slippery little minx, your friend.
Likes to work her mouth too, 
doesn’t she? Yak yak yak. What 
is this I’m eating, by the way? 

HARRY 
Dragon balls. 

As Cormac’s face freezes, Harry starts to head toward Slughorn when the HANGING IS SWEAP ASIDE: Snape. 

SNAPE 
What’s going on back here? 

Cormac SPEWS raw dragon all over Snape’s shoes. Snape surveys the damage, then his eyes rise darkly. 

SNAPE 
You’ve just bought yourself a month’s detention, McLaggen. 

McLaggen dashes off. Harry makes to follow. 

SNAPE 
Not so quick, Potter. 

HARRY 
I think I should rejoin the party,
sir. My date... 

SNAPE 
... can surely survive your absence for another minute or two. 

(MORE) 






SNAPE (CONT'D) 
Besides, I only wish to convey a 
message. 

SNAPE (CONT'D) 
Besides, I only wish to convey a 
message. 

HARRY 
A message...? 

SNAPE 

From Professor Dumbledore. He 

asked that I give you his best and

that he hopes you enjoy your

holiday. You see, he’s traveling

and won’t return until term 

resumes. 

HARRY 
Traveling? Where? 

Snape merely stares a Harry silently, briefly, then exits, taking Harry’s gaze with him, to Slughorn once again, wildly gesturing with a full glass of wine. 

MALFOY (O.S.)

Take your hands off me, you

filthy squib! 

A frown overtakes Slughorn’s face and he turns toward the source of the commotion, exits Harry’s view. Harry emerges from the hanging, finds Malfoy in Filch’s rough grip. 

FILCH 

Professor Slughorn, sir! I’ve 

just discovered this boy lurking

in an upstairs corridor. He 

claims to have been invited to 

your party. 

MALFOY 

Okay, okay, I was gate-crashing.

Happy? 

SNAPE 
I’ll escort him out. 

Draco’s eyes shift, regard Snape. He shrugs free ofFilch. 

MALFOY 
Certainly... Professor. 

72 EXT. DARK CORRIDOR - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 72 

CAMERA GLIDES in the DARKNESS. VOICES are HEARD. 






MALFOY (O.S.) 

Maybe I did hex that Bell girl.
Maybe I didn’t. What’s it to you? 

Two SILHOUETTES come INTO VIEW -- Malfoy, slumped against the wall in lazy insolence, and Snape. 

SNAPE 

I swore to protect you. I made 
the Unbreakable Vow -


MALFOY 

I don’t need protection. I was 
chosen for this! Out of all 
others. Me! And I won’t fail 
him. 

SNAPE 

You’re afraid, Draco. You attempt to conceal it, but it’s obvious. 
Let me assist you -


MALFOY 

No! I was chosen. This is my moment! 

Malfoy exits. Then Snape. 

WIDER ANGLE 

Harry is revealed in an adjacent alcove. He’s heard all. 
A TRAIN is HEARD... 

73 EXT. HOGWARTS EXPRESS - MOVING - DAY 73 

The Hogwarts Express CHUGS through a SNOWY COUNTRYSIDE. 

74 INT. HOGWARTS EXPRESS - MOVING - DAY 74 

Ron lies on his back, while Harry sits opposite, leafing through the Half-Blood Prince’s potions book. 

RON 

Unbreakable Vow. You’re sure 

that’s what Snape said. 

HARRY 
Positive. Why? 

RON 

It’s just, well, you can’t break

an Unbreakable Vow. 






HARRY 
I’d worked that much out for 
myself, funnily enough. 

RON 
No, you don’t understand -- Oh,
bloody hell... 

Lavender stands outside the compartment door. Fogging the glass with her breath, she ETCHES “Ron + Lav,”
encircles it with a HEART, mimes “I miss you,” and exits with a pout. 

HARRY 
Lovely. 

RON 
All she wants to do is snog me.
My lips are getting chapped.
Look. 

HARRY 
I’ll take your word for it. 

Just then, Hermione passes by, breaks stride as she spotsLavender’s handiwork, then continues on. Ron shakes his 
head. 

HARRY 
So what happens? If you break anUnbreakable Vow? 

Ron glowers, watching as Lavender’s heart slowlyVANISHES. 

RON 
You die. 

75 INT. WEASLEY HOUSE - SAME TIME - NIGHT 75 

The house glows with light and HOLIDAY MUSIC rings from the WIRELESS. Fred and George fill cups with STEAMING NOG and Mrs. Weasley and Ginny ferry plates of food. 

MRS. WEASLEY 
Eat up, eat up, everyone! There’s 
more to come! 

Harry sits in deep conversation with LUPIN, TONKS, and MR. WEASLEY. Ron sits by silently. Lupin looks haggard. 






HARRY 
Draco’s plotting something, I know it, something to do withVoldemort. He’s been given a task or a mission -- and Snape was offering to help. 

LUPIN 
Voldemort has chosen Draco Malfoy for a mission? 

HARRY 
I know it sounds mad -


LUPIN 
Has it occurred to you, Harry,
that Snape was simply pretending to offer Draco help so that he could find out what he’s up to? 

HARRY 
That’s not what it sounded like. 

TONKS 
Perhaps Harry’s right, Remus. To 
make an Unbreakable Vow, after 
all -


LUPIN 
It comes down to whether or not 
you trust Dumbledore’s judgement.
He trusts Snape. Therefore, I do. 

HARRY 
But Dumbledore can make mistakes. 
He’s said it himself -


LUPIN 
You’re blinded by hatred. 

HARRY 
I’m not -


LUPIN 

(sharply)
You are! People are disappearing,
Harry. Daily. We can only put our trust in a handful of people.
If we start fighting amongst ourselves, we’re doomed. 

Tonks gives Harry a furtive glance, as if to say, “Leave it.” 







GINNY 
Open up, you. 

Harry turns, finds Ginny, holding something in her fingers. 

GINNY 
Don’t trust me? 

He obliges and she pops a SMALL TART in his mouth. 

HARRY 
It’s good. 






GINNY 
‘Course ‘tis. Made them myself. 

She smiles at him, hooks her ginger hair over one ear and Ron plops down between them. Big brother to the rescue. 

76 EXT. REEDS (SURROUNDING BURROW) - NIGHT (LATER) 76 

Within the reeds. An eerie POV. TRACKING Harry and Mr.
Weasley as they walk from the house to the adjacentWORKSHOP. 

77 INT. MR. WEASLEY’S WORKSHOP - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 77 

Harry trails Mr. Weasley through his cluttered workshop,
which is chock-a-block with MUGGLE OBJECTS: Steam irons. 
Toasters. Clock radios. Plugs. Lots of plugs. The 
PARTY can still be heard, drifting faintly from the main house. 

MR. WEASLEY 

You’ll have to forgive Remus. It 

takes its toll -- his condition. 

HARRY 
(studying him)
Are you alright, Mr. Weasley? 

Arthur tries a smile, but it fades. He frowns, pained. 

MR. WEASLEY 

We’re being followed, all of us.

Molly doesn’t leave the house most

days. It’s not been easy. 

HARRY 
(a nod, then)
Did you get my owl? 

MR. WEASLEY 

Yes, but I thought it best if I

replied in person. If 

Dumbledore’s traveling, it’s news

to the Ministry. But perhaps

that’s the way Dumbledore wants

it. As for Draco Malfoy -- I know

a bit more. 

HARRY 
Go on. 






MR. WEASLEY 

I sent an agent to Borgin &

Burkes. From what you describe, I

think what you and Ron saw at the

end of the summer -- the object

that Draco seemed so interested in 

-- was a Vanishing Cabinet. 

HARRY 
A Vanishing Cabinet? 

MR. WEASLEY 

They were all the rage when

Voldemort first rose to power.

You can imagine the appeal.

Should the Death Eaters come 

calling, one needed only slip

inside and disappear for an hour 

or two. But they’re tricky

contraptions. Require a

tremendous amount of looking

after. Eventually they fell out

of favor. 

HARRY 

What happened to it? The one at 

Borgin & Burkes? 

MR. WEASLEY 
Nothing. It’s still there. 

Harry nods, pondering this. 

MR. WEASLEY 

Harry. You know, I went through

all this before -- the last time 

around. Times like these -- dark 

times -- do funny things to

people. It can bring them

together and it can tear them 

apart. Things... speed up. It’s 

what happens when you don’t know

if today will be your last. 

78 EXT. REEDS (SURROUNDING BURROW) - NIGHT (LATER) 78 

Similar eerie POV. On the porch, Molly and Arthur,
looking middle-aged and fragile, say goodbye to Lupin and Tonks. 




79 EXT. PORCH - SAME TIME - NIGHT 79 
While the others TALK, Lupin stands a bit off to the side, staring into the reeds. His nostrils flair subtly. 
TONKS 
It was delicious, Molly. Really. 
MRS. WEASLEY 
You’re sure you won’t stay? 
TONKS 
No, we should go.
(under her breath)
The first night of the cycle is always the worst -Tonks 
gestures vaguely to the moon. Arthur glances atLupin. 
ARTHUR’S POV - LUPIN’S HAND 
... as the HAIRS on the knuckles RISE. 
BACK TO SCENE 
Remus...? 
MRS. WEASLEY 
80 INT. WEASLEY HOUSE - SECOND FLOOR - SAME TIME - NIGHT 80 
Harry peers through the ripples of an imperfect windowpane, studying the others below. A FLOORBOARD 
CREAKS. He turns, watches Ginny emerge into the light,
in a robe, twisting her wet hair in a towel. 
GINNY 
Everyone gone to bed? 
HARRY 
Soon. 
GINNY 
I don’t sleep these days. So I 
wash my hair. Silly, right? 
Harry just stares at her, the air prickling with silence.
Ginny eyes him knowingly. 
GINNY 
Happy Christmas, Harry. 




81 EXT. PORCH - SAME TIME - NIGHT 81 
Lupin continues to peer into the reeds.
CONTRACT. 
His PUPILS 
Sweetheart... 
TONKS 
LUPIN 
There’s someone out there. I can 
smell him. There’s more than 
one -Suddenly 
-- throughout the reeds -- TORCHES BLAZE. 
82 INT. WEASLEY HOUSE - SECOND FLOOR - SAME TIME - NIGHT 82 
The rippled window behind Harry blushes with light.
Ginny’s eyes shift from Harry to the trees beyond. 
Oh my god... 
GINNY 
Harry turns, his BREATH FOGGING the WINDOWPANE as, far below, FLAMES SNAKE out of the reeds and SLITHER toward 
the house. Bellatrix emerges, peering up through the darkness toward Harry’s SILHOUETTE, a mad grin on her face. As she SHRIEKS EERILY, his eyes flash with hatred. 
83 EXT. WEASLEY HOUSE - PORCH - SAME TIME - NIGHT 83 
Harry bursts through the front door, wand drawn, pelts toward Bellatrix. She grins, turns, and vanishes into the reeds. 
Harry, no! 
MR. WEASLEY 
Flames race up the porch steps, climb the walls of the house. Lupin draws his wand and races after Harry. 
Remus! 
TONKS 
Ron, Fred and George appear, join Arthur as he dashes toward the smoking marsh. Arthur glances back as Ginny 
emerges. 
MR. WEASLEY 
Ginny, stay with your mother! 
Without hesitation, she races for the reeds. 




84 EXT. REEDS (SURROUNDING BURROW) - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 84 

Harry careens through the marsh, reeds flashing past,
then spies Bellatrix. She GRINS, looking like a crazed wood nymph, then flits off, her LAUGHTER mocking him. As 
he pursues, FIRE SNAKES through the reeds toward him. 

NEW ANGLE 

Fred, George, Ron and Arthur fan out, running full-out,
their feet kicking up SPARKS as SHADOWS splinter throughout the reeds. It’s like chasing ghosts. 

NEW ANGLES 

Ginny, copper hair gleaming, races through the reeds. 

Bellatrix leads Harry on, grinning madly. 

Ginny comes dashing to a halt, chest heaving as she peers into the smoking marsh. A HUGE FIGURE QUIVERS through a veil of smoke. Ginny’s eyes SHIFT, see Bellatrix racing forward through the reeds, then SHIFT back as the veil of smoke evaporates, reveals... Greyback. Bellatrix makes 
an ODD, CLICKING noise -- like a signal -- and Greyback edges forward, sweeping away the reeds in front of him and revealing... 

... Harry as he pelts forward. 

GINNY 

No, Harry! It’s a trap! 

Harry falters, looking toward Ginny’s voice and spiesGreyback. Bellatrix stops dead, wheels in her tracks and, seeing Ginny, SHRIEKS with RAGE. Raising her wand,
she fires a BOLT of RED LIGHT which explodes in a SHOWER of SPARKS around Ginny. Ginny fires back, then wheels away, flashing through the reeds and coming face to face with... 

Greyback, sharp teeth glittering. 

GREYBACK 
Don’t you smell clean. 

Just then, a BOLT OF BLUE bursts off Greyback’s back and he turns, sees Harry standing several yards off. As 
Greyback gives chase, Ginny pelts after and we CUT BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN Harry, Ginny and the beast between them, faster and faster, their BREATHS shortening until... 






Greyback rushes into a clearing, panting, glancing about. 

Just then, TWIN BOLTS of light blast from opposite sides of the clearing and Greyback is lifted in the air,
slammed to the ground. As he regains his feet he looks into the reeds and sees Harry and Ginny, wands poised.
He grins... when Bellatrix’s odd, CLICKING signal carries through the night once again. Turning away, he exits. 

Harry and Ginny slowly step out of the reeds, stare at each other wordlessly. Then... Ron, Fred, George, Arthur and Lupin come thrashing into the clearing, stop. All 
around them, the reeds SMOKE, the flames dying. Across 
the marsh, Bellatrix’s cackle rises briefly on the air --
then all is quiet. 

HERMIONE (V.O.)
You’re lucky you weren’t killed. 

85 INT. HOGWARTS CASTLE - CORRIDOR - SAME TIME - DAY 85 

Hermione reads the Daily Prophet as she walks alongsideHarry. The HEADLINE is GLOOMY: “MORE DISAPPEARANCES.” 

HERMIONE 

You have to realize who you are,

Harry. 

HARRY 

(sharply)

I know who I am, Hermione, 

alright?

(frowning)
Sorry. 

HERMIONE 
So tell me what Arthur said. 

HARRY 

If Dumbledore’s traveling places,

it’s news to the Ministry. But 

get this: that night at Borgin &

Burkes? It seems Draco was 

looking at a Vanishing Cabinet. 

HERMIONE 

What would Draco want with a 

Vanishing Cabinet? 

HARRY 
You tell me. 

Hermione frowns, pondering this. Then: 







HERMIONE 
He looks different, don’t you think? Draco. Almost... ill. 

HARRY 
Who could tell the difference? 






RON (O.S.)

Lav, c’mon. Of course I’ll wear 

it. 

They glance ahead, see Ron and a pouting Lavender. Ron 
holds a GOLD CHAIN which spells out “My Sweetheart.” 

LAVENDER BROWN 
That’s my Won-Won. 

HERMIONE 
Excuse me, I have to go vomit. 

As Hermione exits, Harry spies Ginny, in an alcove,
sitting by as Dean laughs with SEAMUS. Looking up, she sees Harry, gives a feeble wave. He waves back and we -


CUT TO: 

86 INT. DUMBLEDORE’S OFFICE - NIGHT 86 

HARRY’S FACE PLUNGING INTO WATER, BREAKING THE SURFACE... 

87 FLASHBACK - INT. SLUGHORN’S OFFICE - NIGHT (YEARS PAST) 87 

We emerge from the CRACKLING EMBERS of a FIREPLACE. A 
much younger -- and more smartly dressed Slughorn probes a dish of CRYSTALLIZED PINEAPPLE as he holds court before 
16-YEAR-OLD TOM RIDDLE and five other BOYS. The CRYSTAL 
HOURGLASS sits on a side table. 

TOM RIDDLE 

Sir, is it true that Professor 

Merrythought is retiring? 

Slughorn chuckles, wags a sugar-encrusted finger atRiddle. 

SLUGHORN 

Now, Tom, I couldn’t tell you if I

knew, could I? I must say, m’boy,

I’d like to know where you get

your information. More 

knowledgeable than half the staff, 

you are.

(as the other boys

laugh)

By the way, thank you for the

pineapple -- you’re quite right,

it is my favorite -- how is it you

knew? 






TOM RIDDLE 
Intuition. 

Riddle smiles but his expression suggests intuition had nothing to do with it. Slughorn chuckles uneasily. 

SLUGHORN 
Good gracious, look at the time.
Off you go, boys, or Professor Dippett will have us all in detention. Lestrange, Avery, 
don’t forget your essays... 

As the others file out, Slughorn busies himself with some papers when -- Ping! -- he turns, finds Riddle still there, standing by the crystal hourglass. 

SLUGHORN 
Look sharp, Tom. You don’t want 
to be caught out of bed after hours... 

TOM RIDDLE 
I know a secret shortcut or two. 

SLUGHORN 
Yes, I imagine you do. Something on your mind, Tom? 

TOM RIDDLE 
Yes, sir. I couldn’t think of 
anyone else to go to. The other 
professors, well, they’re not like 
you. They might... misunderstand. 

SLUGHORN 
Go on. 

Riddle slips off the RING on his left hand, begins to roll it between his fingers. It is set with a BLACK 
STONE. 

TOM RIDDLE 
I was in the library the other night, in the Restricted section,
and I read something rather odd,
about a bit of rare magic, and I thought perhaps you could illuminate me... 

Suddenly, a DENSE FOG engulfs the room and SLUGHORN’S VOICE twists into an ANGRY SHRIEK: 




87 


87. 
87 
SLUGHORN 
I don’t know anything about such things and I wouldn’t tell you if I did! Now get out of here at once and don’t ever let me catch 
you mentioning it again! 
The FOG grows thicker and... 
88 INT. DUMBLEDORE’S OFFICE - NIGHT (PRESENT) 88 
... CAMERA EMERGES FROM the swirling Pensieve. Harry blinks, finds Dumbledore studying him from across the 
room. 
DUMBLEDORE 
Confused? I would be surprised if you weren’t. 
HARRY 
I don’t understand -- what 
happened? 
DUMBLEDORE 
This is perhaps the most important memory I’ve collected. It’s also 
a lie. 
(off Harry’s look)
This memory has been tampered with. In this case by the person whose memory it is, our friend Professor Slughorn. 
HARRY 
But why would he tamper with his own memory? 
DUMBLEDORE 
I suspect he is ashamed of it. 
Why? 
HARRY 
Why indeed. 
DUMBLEDORE 
Dumbledore trails his withered fingers in the Pensieve. 
DUMBLEDORE 
I asked you to get to know Professor Slughorn and you’ve done 
so. 
(MORE) 






DUMBLEDORE (CONT'D) 
Now I want you to persuade him to divulge his true memory. Any way 
you can. 

DUMBLEDORE (CONT'D) 
Now I want you to persuade him to divulge his true memory. Any way 
you can. 

HARRY 
I don’t know him that well, sir --

DUMBLEDORE 
You’re the Chosen One, Harry. And 
Horace is, at heart, a decent man. 
Provide the proper circumstances and he will confess his sins. 

Dumbledore lifts his fingers from the Pensieve, studies them. They are, in this moment, iridescent, whole. 

DUMBLEDORE 
This memory is everything, Harry. 
Without it, we are blind. Without 
it, we leave the fate of our world 
to chance. You have no choice. 
You must not fail. 

As Harry watches, the damp sheen enveloping Dumbledore’s hand evaporates and once again his fingers decay. 

89 INT./EXT. SLUGHORN’S CLASSROOM - DAY 89 

As the CLASS BELL RINGS, a group of FIRST YEARS rise. 

SLUGHORN 
Now don’t forget to look over the chapter on antidotes. I’ll be 
poisoning one of you next time we 
meet. I’m joking! Off you go!
Don’t forget your rattails, Miss Alys. 
 
As the tiny ones scurry out, Harry is revealed, waiting just outside the door. He enters. For a moment, 
Slughorn merely HUMS over his briefcase, unaware.
Then... 

SLUGHORN 
Ah! If it isn’t the Prince of 
Potions himself! To what do I owe 
the pleasure? 

HARRY 
Well, sir, I wondered if I might  ask you something. 

SLUGHORN 
Ask away, my dear boy, ask away! 






HARRY 
Well, you see, the other day I was in the Restricted Section -- in 
the library -- and I stumbled upon something rather odd while 
reading. Something about a bit of 
rare magic... 

SLUGHORN 
Yes? And exactly what was this rare magic. 

HARRY 
I’m not sure... That is, I don’t 
recall the name... exactly. But 
it got me wondering... Are there some kinds of magic you’re not allowed to teach? 

Slughorn looks up, eyes Harry carefully. 

SLUGHORN 
I’m a Potions Professor, Harry.
Perhaps your question would best be posed to Professor Snape. 

HARRY 
Yes, well, we don’t exactly see eye-to-eye, sir. What I mean to 
say is, he’s not like you. He 
might... misunderstand. 

Recognition flickers in Slughorn’s eyes. A glint of fear. 

SLUGHORN 
There can be no light without the dark. And so it is with magic.
Myself, I have always strived to live within the light. I suggest you do the same. 

Slughorn gathers his briefcase, starts to exit. 

HARRY 
Did you say the same to Tom Riddle, sir? When he came asking questions. 

Slughorn freezes in the doorway, then slowly turns. 

SLUGHORN 
Dumbledore put you up to this.
Didn’t he? Didn’t he! 






HARRY 

Sir --
Slughorn silences him with an upraised hand.
without another word, he is gone. 
Then, 
90 INT. CORRIDOR - DAY (MOMENTS LATER) 
Lightning flashes. Thunder rumbles. Rain lashes the 
windows. Through the birdcage’s grid of wires someone approaches. We RACK FOCUS... FIND Harry. As he passes,
we HOLD ON the cage. One bird is missing. Only the BLACK one remains. As thunder BOOMS, the bird RUFFLES 
its feathers. 
90 
Harry glances down the corridor adjacent, sees a FIGURE start up the far stairwell. As the SHADOW ASCENDS, Harry follows. 
91 INT. CORRIDOR - SAME TIME - DAY 91 
The FIGURE continues on, passes OUT OF VIEW.
follows. 
Harry 
92 INT. CORRIDOR - SAME TIME - DAY 92 
Harry, still trailing. The FIGURE turns a corner... 

93 INT. SEVENTH FLOOR CORRIDOR 93 
... comes INTO VIEW. It’s Draco. He stops halfway down,
looks back the way he came. HARRY’S SHADOW scales the 
wall as he approaches. Draco watches calmly, then turns,
CLOSES HIS EYES. And simply... DISAPPEARS. 
Harry turns the corner. Stops. No one. 

94 INT. ROOM OF REQUIREMENT - DAY (SECONDS LATER) 
Draco wends his way through the towering shelves, removes the tapestry and faces the gleaming cabinet. He reaches 
into his coat and carefully removes the WHITE BIRD.
Holding it in one hand, he studies it, gently stroking its feathers with the other. For a moment, he seems lost 
in the activity, lost in the bird’s coal black eyes, its bobbing head. Then, gently, he places it in the cabinet and closes the door. Waits. 
94 
When he opens the cabinet, the bird is gone.
the cabinet once more. 
He closes 






A feather, white and gleaming, clings to the cuff of his jacket. He takes it, turns it in the light. It is 
fragile, translucent. He looks briefly lost again, then blinks, turns back to the cabinet, slowly reaches out and opens it. The bird is there. 

Dead. 

95 INT. COMMON ROOM - NIGHT 95 

Hermione does her homework while Harry peers at the Marauder’s Map. They are the only ones present. 

HERMIONE 

Did you actually expect you could

just walk up to Ol’ Sluggy and ask 

him to reveal his deepest, darkest

secret? Honestly, Harry,

sometimes I think the Daily

Prophet should call you the Dim

One. 

HARRY 
Nice. 

HERMIONE 

(rising to go)

You’re going to have to persuade

him somehow. And now, I’m afraid, 

you’ve made it a lot harder. 

HARRY 

Hermione. I think Malfoy’s

leaving the castle. 

Hermione stops dead, looks back at Harry. He nods. 

HARRY 

I’ve seen it. Sometimes... 

sometimes he just disappears off

the Map. 

HERMIONE 

That’s... not possible. No one 

can leave the castle these days.

The Map is wrong. 

HARRY 
The Map is never wrong. 

Hermione frowns, thinking, then shakes her head, turns 
away. 




96 INT. BOYS’ DORMITORY (GRYFFINDOR TOWER) - NIGHT (LATER) 96 

Harry slumps into the darkened dormitory. Stops. On the 
floor, glittering in the moonlight, is a trail of CANDY FOILS. A bit further along, Ron sits in his PJ’s upon the window sill, a HEART-SHAPED BOX by his side. 

RON 
It’s beautiful, isn’t it? The 
moon. 

HARRY 
Divine. Had ourselves a little 
late-night snack, did we? 

RON 
It was on your bed. The box. 
Thought I’d try one... 

HARRY 
Or twenty. 

RON 
I can’t stop thinking about her,
Harry. 

HARRY 
Really? Honestly, I reckoned she was starting to annoy you. 

RON 
She could never annoy me. I 
think... I think I love her. 

HARRY 
Excuse me? 

Ron nods. Harry looks bewildered. 

HARRY 
Well... Brilliant. 

RON 
Do you think she knows I exist? 

HARRY 
Bloody well hope so. She’s been 
snogging you for three months. 

RON 
Snogging? Who’re you talking about? 

HARRY 
Who’re you talking about? 






RON 
Romilda, of course. Romilda Vane. 

Harry stares at Ron... then grins. 

HARRY 
Okay. Very funny. 

He turns to his bed, throws back the covers when... the 
heart-shaped box caroms off his head. 

HARRY 

What the hell was that for? 

RON 
It’s no joke! I’m in love with 
her! 

HARRY 
Okay! Fine! You’re in love with 
her! Have you ever actually met 
her! 

RON 
No. Can you introduce me? 

Harry stops rubbing his head, eyes Ron oddly, then glances at the candy box at his feet. There is an 
envelope. Taking it, he slides out a card: “Dear Harry.
Thinking sweet thoughts of you. Happy Valentine’s Day.
Romilda.” He suppresses a smile. 

HARRY 
Ron, these chocolates, they’re --
C’mon. I’m going to introduce you to Romilda Vane. 

97 INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 97 

Harry leads Ron, still in his PJs, toward a door. 

RON 
How do I look? 

HARRY 
Devastatingly handsome. 

Harry RAPS on the door. FOOTSTEPS -- followed by a LOUD CRASH. 

SLUGHORN (O.S.) 

Damn it all! 






The door OPENS. Slughorn stands in a GREEN VELVET DRESSING GOWN and matching NIGHTCAP, looking bleary-eyed and annoyed. Something SMOKES on the floor behind him --
the FLOOR LAMP he’d sent wobbling the night of the dinner 
party. 

SLUGHORN 

Yes???!!!! 

(warily)

Oh. Potter. It’s you. I’m 

afraid I’m busy at the moment --

He starts to close the door. Harry sticks his foot in. 

HARRY 

Sir. I’m sorry. I wouldn’t 

bother you if it weren’t

absolutely --

RON 
Where’s Romilda? 

Slughorn squints over Harry’s shoulder at Ron who is doing precisely the same from the other side. 

SLUGHORN 
What’s the matter with Wenby? 

Harry leans forward, WHISPERS into Slughorn’s ear. He 
frowns. 

SLUGHORN 
Ah. Very well. Bring him in. 

98 INT. SLUGHORN’S OFFICE - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 98 

Slughorn, with practiced ease, mixes a concoction of powders and potions into a goblet while Ron peers into a mirror. As he paces, Harry passes “the shelf” and finds,
front and center, a PHOTOGRAPH of himself and Slughorn --
the one taken at the Christmas party. In deep b.g. is photograph of Snape, as a young student, clutching hisPOTIONS TEXTBOOK. 

SLUGHORN 

I’d have thought you could whip up

a remedy for this in no time,

Harry -- an expert potioneer like 

you. 

HARRY 

I figured this called for a more

practiced hand, sir. 






RON 
Hello, darling. Fancy a drink? 

Slughorn and Harry turn, watch Ron WINK into the mirror. 

SLUGHORN 
Hm. Perhaps you’re right. 

As Slughorn goes back to mixing, Harry eyes him furtively. 

HARRY 
I’m sorry, sir. About the other 
day. Our... misunderstanding. 

Slughorn eyes Harry briefly, looks away. 

SLUGHORN 
Yes, well, water under the bridge as they say, correct? 

HARRY 
I mean, I’m sure you’re tired of 
it, after all these years. The 
questions. About... Voldemort. 

Slughorn’s mixing hand falters instantly. 

SLUGHORN 
I’ll ask you not to use that name. 

Slughorn’s stare is fierce. Finally, he turns, goblet in hand, and puts a smile on his face, his voice cheery. 

HARRY 
Yes, sir. It’s just, well,
Dumbledore once said that fear of 
a name only increases fear of the thing itself. It seemed sensible. 

SLUGHORN 
With all due respect, Dumbledore sometimes forgets that most of us do not possess powers so great that we can risk offending the most dangerous Dark Lord who ever lived. 

Slughorn’s stare is fierce, as fierce as the one Dumbledore fixed Harry with. Finally, he turns away. 

SLUGHORN 
Alright, m’boy! Bottoms up! 







RON 

What’s this? 






SLUGHORN 
A tonic for the nerves. 

Ron drinks. Beams briefly. Then his grin sags. 

RON 
What happened to me? 

HARRY 
Love potion. 

SLUGHORN 
And a bloody strong one at that. 

RON 
I feel really... bad. 

SLUGHORN 
Pick-me-up’s what you need, m’boy.

(eying Harry again)
Do us all good, I think. I’ve got butterbeer, wine -- ah -- and a 
dazzling oak-matured mead. I had 
other intentions for this but 
given the circumstances... 

Slughorn takes a STOUT BOTTLE and fills a glass for Ron.
As Ron SIPS, Slughorn fills a pair for he and Harry. 

SLUGHORN 
There we are, Potter. To life! 

CRASH! -- Ron’s glass hits the floor and he crumples to his knees, then tumbles full out on the rug, SPASMING 
horribly, FOAM oozing over his lips. Harry rushes to him. 

HARRY 
Ron! Ron!!! Professor, help him! 

SLUGHORN 
I d-don’t understand -


HARRY 
Professor! Do something!! 

Slughorn shuffles haplessly through his bag, MUMBLING, at a loss. Harry turns back to Ron -- his skin is turningBLUE. 

HARRY 

He’s choking!! 






Harry glances about, then leaps up, and frantically begins to strip the walls of its potion stores, looking for something, anything. A box tumbles, something spills: a scattering of stones, no bigger than a robin’s egg, shriveled and dry. Snatching one, he wrenches open Ron’s jaw and THRUSTS it deep into his THROAT. InstantlyRon stops moving, paralyzed. The room is suddenly silent. He’s not breathing. Harry places both hands behind Ron’s head and gives it a SHAKE. Another. 

HARRY 

Breathe! C’mon, Ron, don’t be a 

prat. Breathe! BREATHE! 

Harry shakes him again and again... then stops. Ron’s 
head rolls limply from his fingers. Slughorn looks on,
mouth agape. Useless. Then... A COUGH, a great hiccupping COUGH -- like a swimmer almost drowned -- and Ron is back. Breathing. 

RON 

These girls are gonna kill me,

Harry. 

Harry grins. Then Ron’s eyes flutter. Out. But 
breathing. 

99 INT. HOSPITAL WING - EARLY MORNING (LATER) 99 

Harry, Dumbledore, Snape, McGonagall, Ginny and a very somber Hermione circle Ron’s bed as MADAM POMFREY 
ministers to him. Slughorn sits off to the side, in a chair, looking stunned. 

DUMBLEDORE 

Quick thinking on your part,

Harry. Using a Bezoar. You must 

be very proud of your student, eh,

Horace? 

SLUGHORN 
Hm? Oh. Yes... very proud. 

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL 

I think we all agree that Mr.

Potter’s actions were heroic. The 

question is: Why were they 

necessary. 

DUMBLEDORE 
Why indeed. 

Dumbledore takes the half-empty bottle of mead, still bearing a bit of GIFTWRAP. 






DUMBLEDORE 

This appears to be a gift, Horace.

You don’t by chance remember who

gave you this bottle, do you --

which by the way possesses

remarkably subtle hints of

licorice and cherry when not

polluted with poison. 

SLUGHORN 

Actually I had intended to give it

as a gift myself. 

DUMBLEDORE 
To whom might I ask? 

SLUGHORN 
You, Headmaster. 

Just then -- the DOOR BURSTS OPEN: Lavender Brown. 

LAVENDER BROWN 

Where is he? Where’s my Won-Won!

Has he been asking for me?

(stopping; glaring daggers)
What’s she doing here? 

HERMIONE 
I might ask you the same. 

LAVENDER BROWN 
I happen to be his girlfriend. 

HERMIONE 
I happen to be his... friend. 

LAVENDER BROWN 

Don’t make me laugh. You haven’t 

spoken in weeks. I suppose you

want to make up with him now that

he’s suddenly all interesting. 

HERMIONE 

He’s been poisoned, you daft

dimbo! And for the record, I’ve 

always found him interesting. 

Hermione frowns, a bit embarrassed. Ron SNORTS, 
stirring. 

LAVENDER BROWN 

Ha! See? He senses my presence.

I’m here, Won-Won. I’m here -







RON 

Er... My... Nee... Er! My! Nee! 

Ron, in a haze, reaches out blindly. Blushing, Hermione takes his hand. Instantly, he falls unconscious again.
Lavender, vibrating with rage, stalks out. Dumbledore 
beams. 

DUMBLEDORE 

Ah, to be young and feel love’s

keen sting. Come, everyone, I

think Mr. Weasley is well tended. 

As Dumbledore leads the others past Harry, Harry studies 
him. Ginny passes, face very close, WHISPERING as she indicates Ron and Hermione. 

GINNY 
‘Bout time, don’t you think? 

Harry watches her go, hopelessly smitten, sees that Slughorn has paused in the doorway. 

SLUGHORN 

I’ve always cherished my students.

They’re my life... 

Then he is gone too. Harry turns back, studies Hermione,
hand enfolded over Ron’s. She looks up, sees his faint smile. 

HERMIONE 
Oh shut up. 

100 INT. GREAT HALL - DAY 100 

Harry spoons soup into his mouth while perusing the Half-
Blood Prince’s Potion book, his eyes lingering, as before, over the SECTUMSEMPRA SPELL: “For Enemies.” Ron 
absently twirls his wand as he covertly eyes Lavender.
Hermione frowns over the Prophet when... a snowflake 
falls upon her nose. 

HERMIONE 

Ron. Stop. You’re making it 

snow. 

RON 
Huh? 

Ron looks up, sees that it is SNOWING exclusively over the trio. Hermione places her hand atop his wand and he blinks, as if the gesture kindles some sense-memory. 






RON 
Tell me again how I broke up withLavender? 

Harry pauses on his soup, exchanges a glance with Hermione, who carefully withdraws her hand from Ron’s. 

HERMIONE 
Um, well, she came to visit you in the hospital, you see, and you talked -- I don’t believe it was a 
long conversation -


RON 
Don’t get me wrong. I’m bloody thrilled to be shot of her. It’s 
just she seems... a bit put out. 

As one, the three glance over at Lavender and are rewarded with a lethal squint. 

HERMIONE 
Does, doesn’t she? And you say you don’t remember a thing from that night? Not one thing? 

RON 
Well... there is... something.

(as Hermione hangs)
But no. It can’t be. Besides, I 
was completely boggled, wasn’t I? 

HERMIONE 
Right. Boggled... 

Hermione slumps back, frowning. Harry smiles with 
amusement. Just then, a MILD COMMOTION draws his 
attention. At the back of the Hall, a group of girls surrounds a new arrival. 

HERMIONE 
That’s Katie. That’s Katie Bell. 

Katie Bell, pale but smiling, greets the other girls.
After a moment, she looks up. Finds Harry standing before her. 

HARRY 
How are you, Katie? 

KATIE BELL 
Give me a moment, girls. 

The girls drift off. Harry watches them go, curious,
then: 






KATIE BELL 

I know you’re going to ask, Harry.

But I don’t know who cursed me. 

I’ve tried to remember. Honestly.

But I just... can’t... 

Katie’s eyes shift. She goes ashen. Harry turns,
follows her gaze and finds... Malfoy, staring at her.
Katie backs away, retreating to the other girls. Harry watches her go, then looks back. Catches Malfoy fleeing the Hall. 

101 INT. CORRIDOR - DAY (MOMENTS LATER) 101 

Malfoy hurtles past, forehead gleaming with sweat, passesOUT OF FRAME. Seconds later, Harry appears, follows. As 
he passes the birdcage... we HOLD. It’s now EMPTY. 

102 OMITTED 102 

103 INT. BATHROOM - SAME TIME - DAY 103 

Malfoy lurches to the mirror, steadies himself against the sink. Then, with a great, heaving shudder begins to... CRY. 

In the MIRROR, we see the bathroom DOOR ease open:
Harry. He stops, stunned. Malfoy’s eyes shift.
Horrified to be exposed. He wheels, points his wand.
WHOOSH! The LAMP next to Harry’s head SHATTERS. FLAMES 
spider up the ceiling. 

Harry draws his own wand, fires back. The CISTERN behind 
Malfoy EXPLODES and WATER sweeps the ceiling, rains down.
Malfoy HOWLS with RAGE. Harry readies himself. 

MALFOY 

Cruci-


HARRY 

SECTUMSEMPRA! 

BLOOD SPURTS from Malfoy’s face and SCARLET SLASHES OOZE through the white of his shirt. He staggers, HOWLS again and COLLAPSES. Harry glares at his wand in horror, then slushes across the floor, the water running red with Malfoy’s blood. 






MALFOY 
Don’t touch me! Don’t you dare touch me! 
Harry stops dead... transfixed by a FLASH of SOMETHING DARK pushing through the wet fabric of Malfoy’s shirtsleeve. Just then... Snape BURSTS THROUGH THE DOOR.
Seeing Malfoy -- and the nature of his injuries -- he eyes Harry with keen curiosity. Kneeling, he traces theTIP of his WAND over Malfoy’s wounds, MURMURING an EERIE INCANTATION. Instantly, the skin begins to knit itself together. Harry backs away, Snape’s ancient CHANT ringing in his ears, blood floating like crimson flowers on the floor, backing away until he reaches the door... 
104 INT. COMMON ROOM - DAY 104 
Harry sits numbly, the Potions textbook lying limp in his hand. Hermione, Ron and Ginny sit together, a bit apart,
keeping a kind of vigil. Finally, Ginny rises, steps to him. 
GINNY 
You have to get rid of it. Today. 
105 INT. SEVENTH FLOOR CORRIDOR - DAY (LATER) 105 
Harry, Potions book in hand, follows Ginny past the empty birdcage and down the corridor when she pauses, turns to the wall and shuts her eyes. 
GINNY 
Take my hand. 
* 
* 
106 INT. ROOM 0F REQUIREMENT - DAY (SECONDS LATER) 
Ginny and Harry materialize. 
HARRY 
The Room of Requirement... 
Ginny nods, turns away. Harry follows. 
106 
NEW ANGLE - SECONDS LATER 
Harry eyes the shelves that tower above him and the odd things they hold: a SMALL CAGE bearing the SKELETON of some long-dead creature. A JAR of QUIVERING EYEBALLS 
which track him as he passes. 






GINNY 
Over the years, if someone had a secret, if they wanted to conceal something, this is where they 
came. Some of these things are almost as old as the castle 
itself. 

HARRY 
Who showed you this? First. 

GINNY 
Fred and George. First year. I 
hid Tom Riddle’s diary here for a time. Wish I’d left it... 

As Ginny drifts in the memory, Harry studies her, then a SCUFFLING SOUND is heard nearby. They turn, look off. 

GINNY/HARRY(at the same time)
What was that? 

They turn back, look at each other. Ginny smiles. Then: 

NEW ANGLE - BEHIND VANISHING CABINET 

Harry and Ginny approach. The SCUFFLING GROWS LOUDER. 
Harry reaches out, pulls aside the tapestry. Reacts. 
The cabinet door VIBRATES. Slowly, he opens it and... 

... the BLACK BIRD flies free in a rush of FLAPPING 
wings. 

GINNY 
See, you never know what you’ll find up here. 

Harry nods, looks back to the cabinet, mystified. 

GINNY 
All right. Close your eyes. That 
way you can’t be tempted. 

Ginny slips the book from his fingers and starts to back 
away. She mouths: Close... your... eyes. As she leaves 
FRAME, CAMERA PUSHES EVER-SO-SLOWLY IN ON Harry. Still. 
Waiting. For a long moment, there is only silence. Then 
a shadow gently eclipses Harry’s face. 

GINNY 
There’s something else. Another 
secret of sorts. One of mine... 






Ginny leans in then and places her mouth on Harry’s. 

GINNY 

That can stay hidden up here too,

if you like. 

Harry opens his eyes, watches Ginny back away, then disappear around the corner. He stares at the empty air,
blinking, then watches the black bird flutter overhead. 

107 INT. CORRIDOR - LATE AFTERNOON (LATER) 107 

Harry, looking a tad dazed, walks aimlessly. 

RON (O.S.)
So. Did you and Ginny do it? 

Harry jumps, watches Ron appear. 

HARRY 
What? 

RON 
You know. Hide the book. 

HARRY 
Oh. Yeah. 

Just then, Slughorn rounds the far end of the corridor and -- spying Harry -- does a little Oliver Hardy “Oops”
and retreats. 

RON 

Still no luck with Slughorn, I

take it? 

Harry shakes his head -- then stops cold, stares at the empty space where Slughorn stood moments before. 

HARRY 
Say that again. 

108 INT. COMMON ROOM - DUSK 108 

The tiny VIAL of FELIX FELICIS glimmers in Harry’s palmas he and Ron and Hermione huddle in the empty dormitory.
They exchange glances, then Harry brings the vial to his lips. 

HERMIONE 
Well? How do you feel? 






HARRY 
Excellent. Really excellent. 

HERMIONE 

Now remember. Slughorn usually

eats early, takes a short walk and

then returns to his office. 

HARRY 

Right. I’m going down to

Hagrid’s. 

HERMIONE 

What? No, Harry -- you’ve got to

go see Slughorn. We have a plan -


HARRY 

No. I’ve got a good feeling about

going to Hagrid’s. I feel like 

it’s the place to be tonight, know

what I mean? 

HERMIONE/RONNo. 

HARRY 
Trust me. I know what I’m doing. 

Or at least Felix does. 

109 INT. CORRIDOR - DUSK (MOMENTS LATER) 109 

A BOY with a PREFECT’S BADGE patrols the corridor.
Bored, he ponders the progress of his FAINT MUSTACHE in a mirror. Harry walks by, unseen. 

110 INT. ENTRANCE HALL - DUSK (MOMENTS LATER) 110 

Filch paces, standing guard while Mrs. Norris sits calmly by. A MOUSE appears in the OPEN helmet of a SUIT OF ARMOR, washes its face with its tiny paws, then spiesMrs. Norris -- who HISSES. The mouse makes a quick retreat and the FACE PLATE comes CLANGING down. As Filch 
wheels, Harry strolls past. 

111 EXT. GROUNDS/HOGWARTS CASTLE - DUSK (MOMENTS LATER) 111 

TWO AURORS, twin SILHOUETTES, patrol the grounds. Harry approaches, about to intersect their paths when, at the last second, something on the ground catches his eye. He 
KNEELS, considers a BEETLE on its back, legs churning helplessly. Harry extends his finger, letting the tiny bug gain purchase, then tips it upright... 







...just as the Aurors’ SHADOWS quiver over him and vanish. Rising, Harry starts off in one direction, then stops, as if compelled by some inner voice, and heads the opposite way. 




112 EXT. GREENHOUSE - DUSK (MOMENTS LATER) 112 

Harry HUMS placidly. Up ahead, a FIGURE ripples beyond the steamy panes of the Greenhouse. It’s Slughorn,
hunched over a PLANT whose TENDRILS coil eerily,
resisting his attentions. Snip! He stealthily removes a sprig, looks up and JUMPS. 

SLUGHORN 
Merlin’s beard, Harry! 

HARRY 

Sorry, sir. I should’ve announced 

myself. Cleared my throat.

Coughed. You probably feared I

was Madam Sprout. 

SLUGHORN 
Well, yes, actually -(
paranoid)
Why would you think that? 

HARRY 

Just the general behavior, sir.

The sneaking around. The jumping

when you saw me. By the way,

those Tentacula leaves -- they’re

quite valuable, aren’t they? 

SLUGHORN 

Ten galleons a leaf to the right

buyer -- not that I’m familiar

with such back alley transactions.

One hears rumors is all. My own

interests are purely academic, of 

course. 

HARRY 

Personally, these plants have

always kind of freaked me out. 

Harry gives a little SHIVER of the shoulders, smiles.
Slughorn cocks his head, studies him oddly. 

SLUGHORN 

Exactly how did you get out of the

castle, Harry? 

HARRY 

Through the front doors, sir. I’m 

off to Hagrid’s, you see. He’s a 

very dear friend and I felt like

paying him a visit. So if you

don’t mind, I’ll be going. 






SLUGHORN 
Harry! 

HARRY 
Sir? 

SLUGHORN 
It’s nearly nightfall. Surely your ealize I can’t allow you to roam the grounds all by yourself. 

HARRY 
Well, then by all means come along, sir. 

113 EXT. HAGRID’S HUT - DUSK (MOMENTS LATER) 113 

Harry appears over a rise, strolling happily along...
when Slughorn appears, huffing and puffing to keep up. 

SLUGHORN 
Harry, I must insist you accompan yme back to the castle immediately! 

HARRY 
That would be counterproductive,
sir. 

SLUGHORN 
And what makes you say that? 

HARRY 
No idea. 

Slughorn frowns impatiently -- then stops, blinks. 

SLUGHORN 
Merlin’s beard... 

Up ahead, Hagrid sits disconsolately upon a stump.
Nearby, Aragog’s massive body lies legs up. 

SLUGHORN 
Is that an actual Acromantula? 

HARRY 
A dead one, I think, sir. 

NEW ANGLE - SECONDS LATER 

Harry and Slughorn approach a sullen Hagrid. 






HAGRID 
‘Arry. ‘Orace. 

SLUGHORN 
My god, dear man. How did you ever manage to kill it? 

HAGRID 
Kill ‘im! Me oldest friend, ‘e 
was! 

SLUGHORN 
I’m sorry, I... (didn’t realize.) * 

Slughorn falters helplessly. Hagrid waves his hand. 

HAGRID 
Ah, don’ worry yerself. Yer not 
alone. Seriously misunderstood creatures -- spiders. It’s the 
eyes, I reckon. Unnerve people. 

HARRY 
Not to mention the pincers. 

Harry makes a little claw motion with his hand, while making a CLICKING sound. Hagrid eyes Harry curiously. 

HAGRID 
I reckon that too... How’d yeh get 
outta the castle anyways? 

HARRY 
Through the front doors. 

SLUGHORN 
Hagrid. I wouldn’t want to be 
indelicate, but Acromantula venom 
is uncommonly rare and, well, if you wouldn’t mind my extracting a vial or two -- purely for academic pursuits... 

HAGRID 
Don’ suppose it’s doin’ ‘im any good, izzit? 

SLUGHORN 
My thoughts exactly! Always carry a few spare ampoules for just such occasions. Old Potion Master’s 
habit, you know... 







Slughorn rummages about his pockets, extracts some SMALL VIALS -- all empty save for one containing a HAIRY WORM --
then scrambles up close to Aragog. Harry and Hagrid watch. 

HAGRID 

Wish yeh coulda seen ‘im in ‘is 

prime. Magnificent ‘e was. Jus’ 

magnificent... 

Hagrid BLINKS wildly, then takes out a handkerchief and SNORTS LOUDLY into it. Slughorn looks up, studies Hagrid’s sorry expression with empathy and steps away. 

SLUGHORN 

Why don’t I say a few words? I 

trust he had family? 

HARRY 
Oh yeah. 

SLUGHORN 
(clearing his throat)
Farewell... 

Slughorn frowns. 

HAGRID 
Aragog. 

SLUGHORN 

(a nod)

Farewell, Aragog, king of

arachnids. Though your body will

decay, your spirit lingers on in

the quiet, web-spun places of your

Forest home. May your many-eyed

descendents ever flourish and your

human friends find solace for the 

loss they have sustained. 

HAGRID 
Tha’ was... tha’ was... beautiful. 

Hagrid wipes his eyes, then rises. He walks to Aragog,
studies him lovingly, then puts a shoulder to the big beast’s body... and sends him tumbling into the freshly-
dug grave adjacent with a SICKENING THUNK. 

HAGRID/SLUGHORN (O.S.)
(singing) 

And Odo the hero, they bore him back home... 




114 INT. HAGRID’S HUT - NIGHT (HOURS LATER) 114 

Harry, Hagrid and Slughorn sit at the massive kitchen table, which is strewn with EMPTY WINE BOTTLES. Hagrid and Slughorn are feeling no pain, while Harry looks clear-
eyed, focused. 

HAGRID/SLUGHORN 

To the place he’d known as a lad,
They laid him to rest with his hat inside out and his wand snapped in two, which was sad... 

As they finish, both men CHUCKLE. Hagrid tops off everyone’s mug with a bit more wine. Harry brings his mug to his lap... then slyly pours it into the bucket at his feet. 

HAGRID 

I had ‘im from an egg, yeh know.

Tiny little thing he was when he

hatched. No bigger’n a Pekinese. 

SLUGHORN 

Sweet. I once had a fish. 

Francis. Lovely little thing.

One day I came downstairs and he’d

vanished. Poof. 

HAGRID 
Tha’s odd. 

SLUGHORN 

Isn’t it? That’s life, I suppose.

One goes along and then... poof. 

HAGRID 
Poof. 

HARRY 
Poof. 

They all nod soberly. Slughorn’s eyes rise to the ceiling. 

SLUGHORN 
That’s never unicorn hair, Hagrid? 

Hagrid looks up, reels a bit. Nods. 

SLUGHORN 

But my dear chap, do you know how

much that’s worth? 






HAGRID 
No idea... no idea at all... 

Thunk! Hagrid’s great shaggy head hits the table.
Instantly, he is SNORING, so DEEPLY his MUG shimmies across the table. Slughorn smiles, regards Harry, who merely stares back. Slughorn averts his eyes. Suddenly 
nervous. A WIND rises outside. Windowpanes rattle. 

SLUGHORN 
It was a student who gave me Francis. One spring afternoon I discovered a bowl upon my desk with a few inches of clear water. 
There was a flower petal floating upon the surface. As I watched, 
the petal sank, but just before it touched bottom... it transformed. 
Into a wee fish. It was beautiful 
magic, wondrous to behold. The 
petal had come from a lily. 

Hearing “lily,” Harry looks up. Slughorn nods. 

SLUGHORN 
Your mother. The day I came downstairs, the day I found the bowl empty... was the day she... 

Slughorn falters, pain etching his face. 

SLUGHORN 
I know what you want. But I can’t 
give it to you. It will ruin 
me... 

Harry studies Slughorn a moment, thinking, then speaks. 

HARRY 
Do you know why I survived? The 
night I got this. 

Slughorn looks up, sees Harry pointing to his scar. 

HARRY 
Because of her. Because she 
sacrificed herself. Because she 
refused to step aside. Because 
her love was more powerful than Voldemort. 

SLUGHORN 
Please don’t say his -







HARRY 
I’m not afraid of the name, 
Professor. And I’m not afraid of 
him. And you shouldn’t be either.
She didn’t just die for me that night. She died for you too. She 
died for everyone who’s ever woken in the middle of the night afraid a Death Eater waited on their 
doorstep. 

Slughorn gazes into the guttering candle before him. 

HARRY 
Professor. I’m going to tell you something, something others have 
only guessed at. It’s true. I am 
the Chosen One. 

Slughorn looks up. Harry nods. 

HARRY 
Only I can kill him. But in order 
to do so, I need to know what Tom 
Riddle asked you that night in your office all those years ago.
And I need to know what you told him. 

Slughorn’s eyes well with tears, his hands tremble. 

HARRY 
Be brave, Professor. Be brave 
like my mother. Otherwise you disgrace her. Otherwise she died 
for nothing. Otherwise, the bowl 
remains empty forever. 

Slughorn shakes his head, staring into the candle.
Finally, slowly, he removes his wand. 

SLUGHORN 
Don’t think too badly of me once you’ve seen it. You don’t know 
what he was like... even then. 

Slughorn fishes out a tiny vial -- the one with the WORM-- but his hand is shaking so violently, Harry has to take it. Slowly, Slughorn raises his wand, touches it to his temple and withdraws a LONG, SILVER THREAD. Harry extends the vial and... it drops within. 




115 INT. DUMBLEDORE’S OFFICE - NIGHT 115 

Dumbledore holds the vial in wonderment. The worm hangs in eerie suspension. 

DUMBLEDORE 
How is he? Horace? 

Harry shrugs. Dumbledore nods, then tips his hand. A 
LONG strand hangs suspended like glass. A pearl forms...
and as it hangs... Harry’s eyes shift, notice a DRAWING 
on Dumbledore’s desk, one of Tom Riddle’s drawings seen 
at the orphanage, of the CAVE and the distinct OUTCROPPING. Then... the pearl drops. 

116 FLASHBACK - INT. SLUGHORN’S OFFICE - NIGHT (YEARS PAST) 116 

As before. The CRACKLING EMBERS of the FIRE. Slughorn,
a circle of six. Riddle commanding the room. 

TOM RIDDLE 

Sir, is it true that Professor 

Merrythought is retiring? 

Slughorn chuckles, wags a sugar-encrusted finger at Riddle. 

SLUGHORN 

Now, Tom, I couldn’t tell you if I

knew, could I? I must say, m’boy,

I’d like to know where you get

your information. More 

knowledgable than half the staff, 

you are.

(as the other boys

laugh)

By the way, thank you for the

pineapple -- you’re quite right,

it is my favorite -- how is it you

knew? 

TOM RIDDLE 
Intuition. 

SLUGHORN 

(an uneasy chuckle)

Good gracious, is it that time

already? Off you go, boys, or

Professor Dippett will have us all

in detention. Lestrange, Avery,

don’t forget your essays... 

The others exit, when -- PING! -- Slughorn turns, eyes the hourglass, finds Tom Riddle still there. 






SLUGHORN 
Look sharp, Tom. You don’t want 
to be caught out of bed after hours... 

TOM RIDDLE 
I know a secret shortcut or two. 

SLUGHORN 
Yes, I imagine you do. Something on your mind, Tom? 

TOM RIDDLE 
Yes, sir. I couldn’t think of 
anyone else to go to. The other 
Professors, well, they’re not like 
you. They might... misunderstand. 

SLUGHORN 
Go on. 

TOM RIDDLE 
I was in the library the other night, in the Restricted section,
and I read something rather odd, 
about a bit of rare magic and I thought perhaps you could illuminate me. It’s called, as I 
understand it... a Horcrux. 

Slughorn’s weak smile evaporates altogether. 

SLUGHORN 
Excuse me? 

TOM RIDDLE 
Horcrux. I came across the term 
while reading and I didn’t fully understand it. 

SLUGHORN 
I’m not sure what you were reading, Tom, but that’s very Dark stuff, very Dark indeed. 

TOM RIDDLE 
Yes, sir. Which is why I came to 
you. I mean no disrespect to the rest of the staff, but I thought if anyone could tell me... it would be you. 

Slughorn frowns, clearly disturbed, then speaks quietly. 






SLUGHORN 
A Horcrux is an object in which a person has concealed part of their soul. 

TOM RIDDLE 
Yes, I thought it might be something like that. But I don’t 
understand how that works, sir. 

SLUGHORN 
One splits one’s soul and hides part of it in an object. By doing so, you are protected should you be attacked and your body destroyed. 

TOM RIDDLE 
Protected? 

SLUGHORN 
That part of your soul that was hidden, lives on. In other words, 
you cannot die. 

Riddle nods and TURNS AWAY, staring at himself in the MIRROR on the wall opposite. A hint of RED glints in his 
eyes. 

TOM RIDDLE 
How does one split his soul, sir? 

SLUGHORN 
I think you can guess the answer to that, Tom. 

TOM RIDDLE 
Murder. 

SLUGHORN 
Yes. Killing rips the soul apart.
It is a violation against nature.
After, one is never the same. 

TOM RIDDLE 
Out of curiosity, sir -- can you only split your soul once? For 
instance, isn’t seven the most 
powerfully magical number -


SLUGHORN 
Seven! Merlin’s beard, Tom! 
Isn’t it bad enough to think of killing one person? To rip the soul into seven pieces...

(MORE) 







SLUGHORN (CONT'D) 
(stopping; worried)
This is all hypothetical, isn’t it, Tom? All academic... 

TOM RIDDLE 
Of course, sir. And I promise I’ll not speak of our conversation. It’ll be our little 
secret... 

Riddle reaches out then and pinches the FLAME of a candle, killing it. As SMOKE RISES, we -


DISSOLVE INTO: 

117 INT. DUMBLEDORE’S OFFICE - SAME TIME - NIGHT (PRESENT) 117 

... the surface of the Pensieve, where Riddle quivers.
We RACK FOCUS and Dumbledore’s troubled face bleeds 
through Riddle’s. 

HARRY 
Sir -


Dumbledore holds up his withered hand, silencing him, 
turns away. Harry studies him, waiting, the hush palpable. 

DUMBLEDORE 

(haunted)
This is beyond anything I imagined. In my life I have seen things that are unimaginably horrific. I know now... you will 
see worse. 

Dumbledore looks off, his eyes distant. Harry watches him intently, as do the HEADMASTERS in their frames above. Finally, tentatively, Harry speaks. 

HARRY 
Do you mean to say he succeeded,
sir? In making a Horcrux? 

DUMBLEDORE 
Oh he succeeded. And not just 
once. Think, Harry. He’s just told us. 

HARRY 
Seven. He made seven -- the most 
powerfully magical number. But... 
what are they exactly? 






DUMBLEDORE 
They can be anything. The most 
commonplace of objects. A ring,
for example. Or a book... 

Dumbledore slides open a drawer, removes the RING and Tom Riddle’s battered DIARY. 

HARRY 
Tom Riddle’s diary -


DUMBLEDORE 
It’s a Horcrux, yes. Four years ago, when you saved Ginny Weasley’s life in the Chamber of Secrets, when you brought me 
this -


(holding up the

diary)
I knew. This was a different kind 
of magic. Very dark. Very powerful. But until tonight, I had no idea just how powerful... 

HARRY 
And the ring...? 

DUMBLEDORE 
Belonged to Voldemort’s mother.
It was difficult to find and... 

(raising his damaged

hand)
... even more difficult to 
destroy. 

HARRY 
But if you could find them all.  
If you did destroy each Horcrux...  

DUMBLEDORE 
One destroys Voldemort. 

Harry begins to reach out for the ring... 

HARRY 
But how would you find them? They  
could be hidden anywhere, couldn’t they... 

DUMBLEDORE 
True. But magic, especially Dark magic... 






Just then, as the flash of Harry’s fingers make contact with the ring, IMAGES FLASH by in DIZZYING succession:
VOLDEMORT’S FACE, twisted in pain. A DERELICT HOUSE, 
deep in a haunted clearing. An ANCIENT CUP, gleaming as it tumbles from an old woman’s hand. A SNAKE (NAGINI) 
slithering through damp grass. Dumbledore slipping the ring onto his finger, recoiling as his skin decays... 

DUMBLEDORE 
... leaves traces. 

Harry’s clenched hand SPASMS, RELEASES. The ring skitters across Dumbledore’s desk and Harry brings a hand to his chest, a look of bewilderment on his face. 
Dumbledore watches the ring spin down, then glances at Harry and slowly extends his own hand, lightly touching the center of Harry’s chest with the tips of ashen fingers, as if reading braille, as if he can somehow “see” into Harry’s heart. Trepidation -- and recognition-- flicker over his face. 

HARRY 

It’s where you’ve been going,

isn’t it, sir? When you leave the

school. 

Harry’s eyes drift once again to the postcard on the desk. Dumbledore withdraws his hand, nodding, still studying Harry oddly, his voice, when it comes, distant. 

DUMBLEDORE 

Yes. And I think... perhaps... I

may have found another. But this 

time I cannot hope to destroy it

alone. 

Harry peers into Dumbledore’s eyes. Dumbledore nods. 

DUMBLEDORE 

Once again, I shall ask too much

of you. 

118 INT./EXT. GARGOYLE CORRIDOR -LATE DAY 118 

Harry stands at a window, looking out. He brings his fingers to his chest again when... Hermione comes up behind him. 

HERMIONE 
Harry. It’s time. 




119 INT./EXT. COURTYARD -LATE DAY (MOMENTS LATER) 

Harry, Hermione and Ron walk. 

HARRY 
Hermione, is the Room of 
Requirement unplottable? 

HERMIONE 
If one wants it to be. Why? 

HARRY 
It would explain why I thought Malfoy was leaving the castle when he disappeared off the Map. 

HARRY 
He was going to the Room of Requirement. 

HERMIONE 
Of course, and that explains the Vanishing Cabinet as well! 

RON 
No. I got an owl from Dad this * 
morning. The one at Borgin &
Burke’s? It’s still there. 

HARRY 
But I’m telling you. I saw it --

Just then, the twins appear, pass. Harry watches them, a thought forming. 

HARRY 
What if there are two? Vanishing cabinets. 

HERMIONE 
What if there are? 

HARRY 
I don’t know... 

Harry watches the twins vanish around a corner. 

RON 
Good luck, mate. 

Harry turns back to Ron and Hermione, neither able to fully conceal heir concern. He smiles reassuringly,
continues on. 






HARRY 

I don’t need luck. I’ll be with 

Dumbledore. 

120 EXT. ASTRONOMY TOWER -DYING LIGHT (LATER) 120 

As Harry trots up the spiraling exterior stairs, he hears VOICES coming from the topmost level and pauses, peering up through the grid-like floor above: Dumbledore and 
Snape. 

SNAPE 

Have you ever considered that you

ask too much? That you take too

much for granted? Has it ever 

crossed your brilliant mind that I

don’t want to do this anymore? 

DUMBLEDORE 

Whether it has or hasn’t is 

irrelevant. I will not negotiate

this with you, Severus. You 

agreed. There’s nothing more to

discuss. 

Harry stands poised, peering upward, where Dumbledore squints toward the dying sun and Snape glares at his back. Finally, Snape turns away and -- before Harry can react -- is descending the stairs. Seeing Harry, Snape falters briefly, then continues on without a word. As 
his FOOTSTEPS fade, Harry ascends to the upper tier.
Dumbledore turns. Smiles. 

DUMBLEDORE 

Harry. You need a shave, my

friend. 

Harry runs his hand over his face. 

DUMBLEDORE 

At times I forget how much you’ve 

grown. At times I still see the 

small boy from the cupboard.

(smiling)

Forgive my mawkishness, Harry. I 

am an old man. 

HARRY 
You look the same to me, sir. 

DUMBLEDORE 

Like your mother, you are

unfailingly kind.

(MORE) 




120 


DUMBLEDORE (CONT'D) 
A trait people never fail to undervalue. I’m afraid. 
120. 
120 
Dumbledore turns then, eyes the fiery sky again. 
DUMBLEDORE 
The place to which we journey tonight is exceedingly dangerous,
Harry. I promised that you could accompany me and I stand by that promise. But there is a 
condition: You must obey any command I give you -- without question. 
Yes, sir. 
HARRY 
DUMBLEDORE 
Understand what I’m saying.
Should I tell you to hide, you must hide. 
Harry nods. 
DUMBLEDORE 
Should I tell you to run, you will 
run. 

Harry nods.  
DUMBLEDORE 
And should I tell you to abandon 
me and save yourself... 
 
Harry’s eyes rise, meet Dumbledore’s.  
DUMBLEDORE 
You will do so. 


Harry hesitates. 
DUMBLEDORE 
Your word, Harry. 
Harry debates this internally, then, finally, nods.  
My word. 
HARRY 
Take my arm. 
DUMBLEDORE 







HARRY 

Sir, I thought one couldn’t

Apparate within Hogwarts. 

DUMBLEDORE 
Being me has its privileges. 

The WIND GUSTS and Harry reaches out. Dumbledore’s CLOAK 
BILLOWS and we are TOSSED INTO... 

121 EXT. OCEAN -DUSK (MOMENTS LATER) 121 

BLACK. Undulating. The sound of WAVES. We EASE UP, out 
of the ocean. A GIANT WAVE crashes over a jagged outcropping. As the SPRAY clears... Dumbledore and Harry are revealed. Dumbledore eyes the TOWERING CLIFF FACE opposite, the CAVE. 

HARRY 
It’s there, isn’t it? 




122 EXT. CAVE - SAME TIME -DUSK 122 

Harry and Dumbledore materialize. It is quiet here,
eerily so, the waves merely distant thunder. As Harry glances about, Dumbledore moves to an archway, passes beyond. Harry follows, finds Dumbledore standing below a towering dome of rock, probing its mysteries with the light from his wand. 

DUMBLEDORE 

This is the place. Oh yes, this

place has known magic.

(closing his eyes)

Where you stand, Harry, Tom Riddle

once stood many, many years ago,

when he was but a poor orphan boy

with a penchant for cruelty... 

Dumbledore’s wand stops briefly in its arc and his face registers pain, as if detecting some past unpleasantry.
He begins to TRACE HIS FINGERS over the surface of the rock. 

DUMBLEDORE 

One wintry afternoon, he lured two

younger classmates to this cave.

What happened is unclear. But 

this much is known: the children 

were damaged. 

Dumbledore begins to MURMUR in a STRANGE WHISPER as his fingers play over the rock... then stop. His eyes open.
He takes a dagger from his robes and draws the blade across his forearm, speckling the rock face with scarlet beads. 

HARRY 

Sir! 

The rock face SIZZLES like acid and begins to crumble,
forming a narrow opening. 

DUMBLEDORE 

In order to gain passage, payment

must be made, payment intended to

weaken any intruder. 

HARRY 
You should’ve let me, sir. 

DUMBLEDORE 

Oh, no, Harry. Your blood is much 

more precious than mine. 




123 EXT. ARCHWAY/UNDERGROUND LAKE - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 123 

Dumbledore and Harry emerge onto the rim of a VAST LAKE teeming with MIST. A chill hangs in the air. 

DUMBLEDORE 
Careful. The water. 

Harry peers into the lake. It is black as ink. 

NEW ANGLE - MOMENTS LATER 

Harry follows Dumbledore around the rim of the lake. In 
the center, a GREENISH GLOW shimmers in the mist. 

DUMBLEDORE 

It’s there. The only question is

how do we get to it? 

HARRY 

We couldn’t, perhaps, just try a

Summoning Charm, sir? 

Dumbledore smiles, motions: Be my guest. Harry lifts his wand. 

HARRY 

Accio Horcrux! 

There is an EXPLOSION and something PALE erupts out of the water. Harry nearly sheds his skin. Dumbledore 
calmly watches it VANISH beneath the surface. 

DUMBLEDORE 
Perhaps not. 

NEW ANGLE - MOMENTS LATER 

Dumbledore leads Harry on. Stops. Takes a step back.
He CLOSES HIS EYES and to Harry’s horror walks right to the lake’s edge. As the dark water laps over the toes of his shoes, Dumbledore PASSES HIS HAND slowly through the air, then closes it... as if gripping something invisible. Taking his wand, he gives his CLENCHED FIST a TAP and a thick coppery-green CHAIN appears out of thin air, extending from the water to Dumbledore’s hand. 

DUMBLEDORE 
If you would, Harry... 

Quickly Harry grasps the end of the chain and together he and Dumbledore pull, end over end, until the PROW of a SMALL BOAT pierces the surface, green with algae. 






NEW ANGLE - MOMENTS LATER 

In eerie silence, the boat cleaves the water, ferrying Harry and Dumbledore toward the GREENISH GLOW. 

HARRY 
Sir... have you ever taken Felix 
Felicis? 

DUMBLEDORE 
Only recreationally. You see, I 
believe one creates one’s own 
luck. 

Harry looks down into the water, watches a FACE skim by beneath the surface. 

HARRY 
Professor... there are bodies in 
this lake. 

DUMBLEDORE 
Yes. 

NEW ANGLE (SMALL ISLAND) - MOMENTS LATER 

Here the GREENISH GLOW is ferocious. As the boat 
arrives, Dumbledore steps out. 

DUMBLEDORE 
Remember... the water. 

Harry nods, steps out carefully and joins Dumbledore at the source of the GLOW -- a BASIN filled with a 
PHOSPHORESCENT LIQUID. Dumbledore extends the tips of his blackened fingers toward the basin, but cannot touch the liquid. 

HARRY 
Do you think the Horcrux is in there, sir? 

DUMBLEDORE 
Oh yes. 

Dumbledore steps back, ponders the basin. Notes the 
CRYSTAL GOBLET sitting beside it. Smiles ruefully. 

DUMBLEDORE 
It has to be drunk. 

(as Harry reacts)
You remember the condition on 
which I brought you with me? 






Harry starts to respond. Stops. Nods. 

DUMBLEDORE 
This potion might paralyze me. It 
might cause me to forget why I’m here. It might create so much pain I beg for relief. You are 
not to indulge these requests,
Harry. It is your job to make sure I keep drinking this potion even if you have to force it down my throat. Understood? 

HARRY 
Why can’t I drink it, sir? 

DUMBLEDORE 
Because I am much older, much 
cleverer... and much less 
valuable. 

(taking the goblet)
Your good health, Harry. 

Dumbledore dips the goblet into the gleaming liquid and brings it to his lips. Drinks deep. Closes his eyes. 

HARRY 
Professor? 

Dumbledore shakes his head, silencing Harry, then dips the goblet once more. Twice more he drinks. His hand 
TREMBLES and he grips the side of the basin. 

HARRY 
Professor? Can you hear me? 

Dumbledore says nothing. The corners of his eyes TWITCH.
His hand TREMBLES, savagely this time, and he nearly drops the goblet. Harry reaches out, steadies his hand. 

DUMBLEDORE 
Don’t... don’t make me... 

Harry eyes Dumbledore’s anguished face, steels himself. 

HARRY 
You... you can’t stop, Professor.
You’ve got to keep drinking. Like 
you said. Remember. 

DUMBLEDORE 

Nooooooo!!! 






Harry staggers back, so primal is Dumbledore’s plea.
Dumbledore’s arm goes slack, the goblet clanging dully against the side of the basin. Harry takes a breath,
steps forward, places his hand over Dumbledore’s, lifts the cup. 

DUMBLEDORE 
Make it stop... Please... make it 
stop... 

HARRY 
It will, sir. It’ll stop. But 
only if you drink... 

Harry, his own hand TREMBLING now, tips the goblet over Dumbledore’s lips. 

DUMBLEDORE 
My fault. It’s all my fault... 

Harry brings the goblet up once more. Dumbledore drinks. 

DUMBLEDORE 
Too much... I can’t... take it... 
I want... to die... kill... kill 
me... KILL ME, HARRY! 

HARRY 
What? 

DUMBLEDORE 
Your word, Harry! Your word! 

HARRY 
No... 

DUMBLEDORE 

KILL ME! IT’S THE ONLY WAY! 

Harry stands paralyzed, unsure what to do. Then... 
Dumbledore collapses, rolls onto his back. Harry pelts forward, dips the goblet into the basin and kneels by Dumbledore. 

HARRY 
One more. Just one more. And 
then -- I promise... I’ll do what 
you say. 

Dumbledore, jaw clinched shut, eyes Harry. 

HARRY 
I promise. 






Dumbledore’s jaw relaxes and Harry pries open his mouth,
tips the liquid down his throat. Pain ripples through Dumbledore’s face. He tries to speak, Harry eyeing him with trepidation, fearful of what he will request. Again and again Dumbledore struggles and then... his eyes... 
open. Find Harry. 

DUMBLEDORE 
Water. 

A shudder of relief goes through Harry. Grinning, he leaps to the basin. A GOLDEN LOCKET now lies at the 
bottom. Harry snatches it up. 

DUMBLEDORE 
Water... 

HARRY 

Aguamenti. 

Instantly COLD CLEAR WATER rises in the basin. 

HARRY 
You did it, sir. Look -


Harry frowns. The goblet is empty. 

DUMBLEDORE 

Water! 

Harry dips the goblet into the basin yet again, brings it to Dumbledore’s lips... but once again finds it empty.
Dumbledore tries to speak, but his lips are CRACKING, his tongue like SAND. He GULPS DRILY for air. 

HARRY 
I’m trying, sir. I’m -


Harry stops. All is silent... except for the SOFT LAPPING of the lake. He considers the GHOSTLY SHAPES 
gliding just below the surface. Deciding, he dips the goblet into the dark water. Instantly, the lake begins to CHURN. Harry backs away, the goblet sloshing in his hand. FACES, pale and haunted, quiver in the roiling 
water. 

Harry tips the water into Dumbledore’s mouth. Dumbledore 
blinks. His tongue probes his lower lip. Harry returns to the water’s edge, hesitates, then plunges the goblet into water once more. Instantly, a SLIMY WHITE HAND snags his wrist and Harry is pulled under. The goblet bobs on the surface. 






NEW ANGLE - UNDERWATER 

Utterly silent. Harry twists madly as HANDS reach for him, turning him this way and that. HAUNTED FACES float 
by. 

NEW ANGLE - THE SURFACE 

Harry breaks the surface, GASPING for air, blinking,
catching a glimpse of Dumbledore slumped against the basin as he is... 

NEW ANGLE - UNDERWATER 

... pulled underwater once again, into the eerie SILENCE of flailing arms. He shakes free again and again, but there are too many hands, too many haunted faces. We 
STAY UNDER a very long time, feel his lungs burning. His 
eyes lose their focus, turning blank. Bubbles trail out 
of his mouth as his face goes slack. He sinks deeper, in free fall, takes one last look at the SHIMMERING SURFACE 
ABOVE, the last thing he will see... when a SHADOW SHIVERS briefly and... 

... the SURFACE SIZZLES with RED LIGHT, like blood, then 
becomes TRANSPARENT, revealing DUMBLEDORE, wand pointed directly at the water. 

NEW ANGLE - THE SURFACE 

Harry breaks the surface, SPITTING UP WATER, GASPING FORAIR. Dumbledore staggers, slumps once more against the basin, weakened by his effort. Harry scrambles up,
steadies him and the lake EXPLODES WITH FIRE. Harry wheels, watches the bodies in the lake twist in pain. 

DUMBLEDORE 
Go... 

Harry turns, confused. Dumbledore’s hand finds his face. 

DUMBLEDORE 
We have to... go. 

Harry glances to the boat. Flames lick the prow,
darkening the wood, but do not destroy it. He nods. 




124 EXT. CAVE - ENTRANCE 124 

Harry and Dumbledore emerge from the cave. Dumbledore, 
pale and weak, scans the stars wearily, leans heavily onHarry. 

HARRY 

Don’t worry, sir. We’re nearly

there. 

DUMBLEDORE 

I am not worried, Harry. I am 

with you. 

A CHOIR IN FULL VOICE RISES ON THE AIR and we -


CUT TO: 

125 INT. GREAT HALL - SAME TIME - NIGHT 125 

We HOLD ON the Gothic glass of the main window. Ambient 
light, ominous and cool, plays across its shimmering surface. Flitwick, arms flowing gracefully, conducts a group of FIFTH YEARS, looks up toward the window, eyes the pulsating light. 

126 EXT. COURTYARD - SAME TIME - NIGHT 126 

McGonagall stands in the courtyard as the CHOIR DRIFTS FAINTLY on the night air. She glances up to the sky, a curious expression on her face, then spies a pair ofFirst Years straggling across the courtyard. 

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL 
To your Houses. No dawdling. 

As they scuttle off, McGonagall looks back to the sky. A 
VORTEX of CLOUDS swirls eerily in on itself. We PULL 
BACK... 

127 INT. CASTLE - WINDOW - SAME TIME - NIGHT 127 

... out of a window, its glass prickling with ambient light, and find Snape standing silently, staring at the gathering storm, his expression inscrutable. The choir a 
murmur. 




128 INT. COMMON ROOM - SAME TIME - NIGHT 128 

Darker than usual. The fire muted. Ron and Hermione sit 
together. Silent. Glance toward the window, the sky beyond. 

129 INT. HOSPITAL WING - SAME TIME - NIGHT 129 

Draco’s face, skin glimmering with the light crawling across the ceiling above him. He stares, unblinking,
swings out of the bed. Bare feet -- Draco’s -- drop to the tiles. 

130 INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 130 

The choir echoes eerily. SIXTH YEARS, little more than 
SHADOWS, hang out, giggling in dark corners. Malfoy glides by in his bare feet. Unnoticed. A ghost. 

131 INT. ROOM OF REQUIREMENT - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 131 

Dense with shadow. Strange slashes of light. Malfoy, a shadow within shadows, pulls the tapestry from the Vanishing Cabinet, steps back... 

He stares at the monolith before him, lifts his wand and 
begins to CHANT eerily. The surface of the cabinet 
glimmers, atremble in the ambient light. Almost alive. 
Then he stops. Looking back, his eyes haunted, he slips 
away. 

Light plays within the cabinet. Movement. Shadows 
flicker within, coalesce. We ease up, reveal... 

Bellatrix. Greyback. And a few friends. Bellatrix 
steps into the light. Glances around. Grins. 

132 EXT. ASTRONOMY TOWER - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 132 

Harry and Dumbledore materialize on the rooftop.
Dumbledore glances above, notes the clouds. 

HARRY 

We need to get you up to the

hospital, sir, to Madam Pomfrey -


DUMBLEDORE 

No. Severus... Severus is who I 

need... Go and wake him... Tell 

him what has happened...

(MORE) 






DUMBLEDORE (CONT'D) 
Speak to no one else... I... I shall wait here... 

DUMBLEDORE (CONT'D) 
Speak to no one else... I... I shall wait here... 

HARRY 
All right. Okay. 

Harry gently disengages from Dumbledore, leaves him leaning against the ramparts. He dashes to the stairwell 
door and, glancing back, sees Dumbledore MUTTERING WEARILY as he GESTICULATES with his blackened hand. 

HARRY 
Sir, are you... praying? 

DUMBLEDORE 

(smiling faintly)
No, Harry. I do not pray. I was 
merely closing a window -- the one that had allowed us to Apparate. 

Harry nods, begins to open the door, when FOOTSTEPS sound. Draws his wand. Dumbledore cocks his head, 
listening. Wincing, he straightens up, as if to mask his infirmity. 

DUMBLEDORE 
Hide yourself below. And do not 
speak or show yourself without my permission. No matter what. 

Harry looks down, through the LATTICEWORK at his feet, to the tier below. The FOOTSTEPS DRAW CLOSER. 

DUMBLEDORE 
Do as I say, Harry. 

Harry hesitates. Dumbledore’s eyes blaze... 

DUMBLEDORE 

Trust me. 

Harry meets Dumbledore’s eyes, then pockets his wand and slips down the stairs. As he reaches the level below, 
the DOOR above FLIES OPEN. Harry peers up through the grid, watches Malfoy come INTO VIEW. 

DUMBLEDORE 
Good evening, Draco. What brings you out on such a fine Spring evening? Or is it Summer? 

Draco stands poised, wand in hand, eyes darting about. 






MALFOY 
Who else is here? I heard you talking. 

DUMBLEDORE 
I often talk aloud to myself. I 
find it extraordinarily useful.
That which sounds sane at a 
whisper can seem utterly mad when said for all the world to hear. 
Haven’t been whispering to yourself, have you, Draco? 

Draco eyes Dumbledore with unease. 

DUMBLEDORE 
You are not an assassin, Draco. 

MALFOY 
How do you know what I am? I’ve 
done things that would shock you. 

DUMBLEDORE 
Like cursing Katie Bell and hoping she would, in turn, bear a cursed 
necklace to me? Like replacing a 
bottle of mead with one laced with 
poison. Forgive me, Draco, but these are attempts so feeble I cannot help but question if your heart has been really in them.
I’m curious. When Voldemort gave you this task, when he asked you to kill me, was it in a whisper? 

MALFOY 
He trusts me! I was chosen! 

Malfoy thrusts out his arm, pulls back his sleeve and reveals the DARK MARK. Dumbledore barely looks at it. 

DUMBLEDORE 
Then I shall make it easy for you. 

Slowly and without intent, Dumbledore draws his wand.  
Instantly Malfoy raises his own.  

MALFOY  
Expelliarumus!  

Harry watches in horror as Dumbledore’s wand flies free,  
clattering across the grid above. Malfoy watches it roll  
to a stop, a curious mixture of fear and awe at his own  
actions. Dumbledore eyes the wand, then Draco. 







DUMBLEDORE 
Well done, Draco. But I warn you.  
Killing is not nearly as easy.  






Malfoy looks into Dumbledore’s eyes, then to the sky, at  
the gathering clouds, twisting darkly, then glances to the stairwell. Dumbledore notices. 

DUMBLEDORE 
You’re not alone. Are you. There 
are others. How? 

A sneering smile plays over Malfoy’s lips. 

MALFOY 
The Vanishing Cabinet in the Room of Requirement. 

DUMBLEDORE 
That cabinet has been broken for 
years. 

MALFOY 
I’ve been mending it. 

DUMBLEDORE 
Ingenious. Let me guess. It has 
a sister. A twin. 

MALFOY 
In Borgin & Burkes. They form -


DUMBLEDORE 
A passage, yes. Very good.

(eyes shifting)
I once knew a boy years ago who made all the wrong choices. Let 
me help you, Draco. 

MALFOY 
I don’t want your help! Don’t you see! I have to do it! I have to! 

(in a whisper)
I’ve got to kill you or he’ll kill 
me. 

DUMBLEDORE 
Say that again, Draco. But aloud 
this time. 

Draco looks deep into Dumbledore’s eyes. His hand 
trembles. Transfixed, Harry watches from the shadows.
Slowly, Malfoy begins to LOWER HIS WAND... when FOOTSTEPS ECHO. The DOOR FLIES OPEN: Bellatrix, Greyback and the others. 

BELLATRIX 
Well now, look what we have here. 
Dumbledore. Wandless and alone. 

(MORE) 






BELLATRIX (CONT'D) 
Cornered in his own castle. Well 
done, Draco. 

BELLATRIX (CONT'D) 
Cornered in his own castle. Well 
done, Draco. 

Harry peers up, eyes flashing angrily at the sound of Bellatrix’s voice. He draws his wand slowly. 

DUMBLEDORE 
Good evening, Bellatrix. I think 
introductions are in order. 

BELLATRIX 
Love to, Albus. But I’m afraid 
we’re on a bit of a tight schedule. 

(to Malfoy)
Do it. 

Malfoy’s wand rises once again. Harry raises his own,
aiming through the grid, poised. Just then, a SHADOW 
splinters through the columns to his right. He looks, 
finds Snape, quiet as a ghost, peering upward.
Carefully, Snape draws his wand, then turns to Harry, a finger to his lips: Shhh. Then he is drifting upward.
Silent. A ghost again. 

GREYBACK 
He doesn’t have the stomach. Like 
his father. Let me finish him. 
In my own way. 

BELLATRIX 
No! The Dark Lord was clear. The 
boy’s to do it. Go on, Draco. 

Now! 

Once again Draco raises his wand, his hand trembling.
Harry’s own arm is stiff, sure. The vein in his hand 
pulsates... 

SNAPE (O.S.)
No. 

Harry watches Snape come INTO VIEW. 

DUMBLEDORE 
Severus... 

BELLATRIX 
Well, look who’s here. Hogwarts own Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. Come to see the 
slaughter? 

DUMBLEDORE 
Severus... please. 






SNAPE 
I gave my word. I made a vow... 

Harry’s eyes dart back and forth frantically, trying to make sense of the scene playing out above. Snape’s arm rises. 

SNAPE 

Avada Kedavra! 

A JET of GREEN LIGHT hits Dumbledore squarely in the chest. For a second he hangs, suspended upon the ramparts, and then... the night swallows him. 

HARRY SCREAMS in RAGE. Bellatrix raises her wand to the 
sky and a DEAFENING BLAST shakes the castle, maskingHarry’s cry. The CLOUDS EXPLODE with GRIM LIGHT, 
mutating into a SKULL. As the Death Eaters flee, Snape’s arm drops limply to his side. 

SNAPE 
You can no longer stay here. 

Draco, stunned, stares at the empty place where Dumbledore stood only seconds before. Snape takes him by the scruff of the neck, forces him through the door, then follows. 

Harry scrambles up the stairs and lurches to the ramparts, BATHED IN THE GREEN LIGHT from above. He peers down. Agony wrecks Harry’s face and he has to steady himself. He looks up into the leering skull above. Rage fills his eyes. 

132A EXT. ASTRONOMY TOWER - SAME TIME - NIGHT 132A 

Snape leads Malfoy and Bellatrix down the spiraling staircase. 

132B INT. SLUGHORN’S CORRIDOR - NIGHT 132B 

Snape leads on, his face a mask as he rounds a corner.
STUDENTS in pajamas and robes peer at the emerald sky,
then turn, stare curiously at their teacher and his companions. Snape sweeps past wordlessly. Draco averts 
his eyes. Bellatrix leers at a TINY FIRST YEAR, leans 
close: 

BELLATRIX 
Boo. 




132C INT. OUTSIDE GREAT HALL -NIGHT 132C 

Hearing FOOTSTEPS, an AUROR turns, is BLASTED off his 
feet as Snape and the others appear. Bellatrix lags,
then steps to the TOWERING DOORS of the Hall, peering upward, past the FLOATING CANDLES to the vaulted ceiling,
solemn as a church. Raising her wand, she sends a FIERY BOLT toward the GRAND WINDOW opposite. As it EXPLODES, a 
BLAST of COLD AIR sweeps the room, EXTINGUISHING THE CANDLES. Snape turns, looks back. Bellatrix simplyGRINS, a mad child. 

132D INT. CORRIDOR - SAME TIME - NIGHT 132D 

As Bellatrix’s BLAST ECHOES, Ron and Hermione -- racing side by side in their regular clothes -- glance at one another, dash on. 

132E EXT. CASTLE - SAME TIME - NIGHT 132E 

Filch, on guard, looks up, watches SHARDS OF GLASS spill from the window like jewels, standing transfixed as the fragments lash his face, draw blood. 

132F INT. CORRIDOR - SAME TIME - NIGHT 132F 

Harry races on, glances out a window and sees Snape and the others racing across a lower courtyard. 

132G EXT. LOWER COURTYARD - SAME TIME - NIGHT 132G 

Malfoy slows, glancing upward, watching the students come to the windows and peer out at the emerald sky. They look like ghosts in their nightclothes. 

BELLATRIX 
Draco! Draco! 
(as he turns)
They’ll kill you if you stay. 

132H INT. CORRIDOR - SAME TIME - NIGHT 132H 

Hermione and Ron push through the other students, who are confused, crying. McGonagall appears, meets Ron and Hermione’s glance, continues on. 




132I EXT. HAGRID’S HUT/GROUNDS - SAME TIME - NIGHT 132I 

Quiet here. A VIEW TOWARD the castle. We HOLD. Slowly FIGURES appear on the horizon. The Death Eaters. 
Greyback. Bellatrix, Draco. And Snape. 

133 EXT. HOGWARTS CASTLE - NIGHT 133 

Harry bursts through the entrance doors, wand in hand.
Before him, the grounds shimmer eerily in the GREEN GLOW.
He sees the FIGURES FLEEING towards Hagrid’s Hut. 

134 EXT. HAGRID’S HUT / GROUNDS - SAME TIME - NIGHT 134 

Snape and the others race toward the edge of the grounds.
Suddenly, Snape pulls up, looks back. Sees Harry sprinting toward him. Malfoy, looking edgy, is watching Harry too. 

SNAPE 
Go on! 






Just then a GIANT FIREBALL erupts into the sky. Snape wheels, sees Bellatrix and the others silhouetted against the flames. They’ve set Hagrid’s Hut ablaze. Malfoy stands paralyzed. 

SNAPE 

Go on! 

NEW ANGLE - HARRY 

Running. Harry bolts forth, wand in hand, vengeance in his eyes. Up ahead, Snape stands stolidly, tall and black against the raging fire. Harry points his wand,
fires a JET of RED LIGHT. Snape doesn’t move, merely lets it streak by his head. Harry stops, chest heaving,
and takes aim again. 

HARRY 

Cruciatus! 

Snape raises his wand, parries the curse with ease. 

HARRY 

Incacerata! 

Once again, Snape deflects the spell. 

HARRY 

Impedimenta! 

Another lazy flick of the arm, another curse defeated.
Harry drops his arm in frustration. 

HARRY 
Fight! Fight back, you coward! 

With staggering quickness, Snape’s wand whips forth and Harry is off his heels and crashing to the earth. 

SNAPE 
Don’t ever associate that word and 
my name again. 

Harry raises himself up on one knee, points his wand when... a JET of RED LIGHT sends him crashing back into the grass. Snape wheels, sees Bellatrix standing behind. 

SNAPE 
No! He belongs to the Dark Lord! 

Bellatrix eyes Snape levelly, then turns, trots off.
Snape glances at Harry, then turns away himself, walking.
Harry grimaces, pulls himself to his feet and aims one last time. 






HARRY 

Sectumsempra! 

Bang! Snape wheels and once more sends Harry flying onto his back. Harry stares at the stars as they wheel over him, when Snape comes INTO VIEW. 

SNAPE 
You dare use my own spells against me, Potter? 

Harry goes still. His eyes shift, meet Snape’s. 

SNAPE 
You may have gotten your mother’s eyes, but you’re as dim as your father. Yes. It’s me. I’m the 
Half-Blood Prince. 

Snape kicks Harry’s wand aside and turns away, joining Malfoy and the others where they wait beyond the flaming ruins of Hagrid’s Hut. They head for the darkness of the treeline. And VANISH. Harry pounds his fist into the ground, then stops. 

HARRY 
Hagrid... HAGRID! 

Harry races toward the hut when the DOOR flies off its hinges. Seconds later, Hagrid stumbles out, beardSMOKING. 

HARRY 
Hagrid! You alright? 

HAGRID 
Take more’n tha’ ter finish me 
off. Not sure about me ‘ouse, 
tho’. But if anybody can put it righ’, Dumbledore can. 

HARRY 
Hagrid, Dumbledore -


HAGRID 
Only thing I can’t reckon is wha’ Snape was doin’ with tha’ lot. 

Hagrid turns then, sees the HUGE THRONG of STUDENTS andSTAFF assembled outside the castle. 






HAGRID 
An’ wha’s this wi’ the Dark Mar’? 
Who’s been killed? 
(stopping)
Where’s Dumbledore, ‘arry? 
Where’s Dumbledore!! 
Harry tries to speak, but he is mute. Hagrid goes still. 
135 EXT. HOGWARTS CASTLE - MIDDLE COURTYARD - NIGHT 135 
Ron, Hermione and Ginny stand with the staff. They turn and watch the throng of students part for Harry and Hagrid. 
Hagrid stops short, shattered by what he sees. Harry pushes on, kneels. Dumbledore’s eyes are closed, his face peaceful. Harry straightens his half-moon spectacles, wipes a trickle of blood from his mouth.
Runs the back of his hand, gently, over the weathered cheek. 
Then he notices something lying beside Dumbledore’s ashen hand: the locket. He takes it, considers it numbly.
Then begins to cry, great shudders of grief wracking his body. Hermione gives Ginny a nudge and she steps forward, drops beside him. At her touch, his head falls 
on her shoulder and she begins to stroke him. Ron looks 
on. Understands all. 
McGonagall lifts a trembling wand to the sky and slowly the TIP GLOWS to life. One after another, students and 
staff do the same, lifting their wands in salute. As 
CAMERA RISES, the pinpricks coalesce into one BLAZING FIRE. The sky, briefly emerald, turns black once more.
The Dark Mark vanishes. 
136 EXT. HOGWARTS CASTLE - DAY 136 
The castle sits silent. 
parapets. 
BLACK BANNERS fly on the 
136A EXT. BRIDGE - DAY 136A * 
Silent. Desolate. * 
137 INT. GREAT HALL - DAY 137 
Dumbledore’s chair -- empty. The House tables -- empty. 




138 INT. CORRIDOR - DAY 
A tapestry tosses lightly in the breeze. The PERCH in  
the empty birdcage sways, SQUEAKING gently. 




139 INT. DUMBLEDORE’S OFFICE - DAY 139 
Quiet. Still. Empty. Then: * 
The door eases OPEN and Harry enters. For a moment, he 
simply stands staring. Taking inventory. Spying something, he crosses to the great desk opposite. Looks 
down. 


Dumbledore’s wand.  
Reaching out, Harry takes it in hand. Old, oft-used and 
bearing the impression of its owner’s fingers, it is a strangely beautiful object. Harry traces his thumb lightly over the wood, transfixed, when... 


... McGonagall enters.  
Potter. 
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL  

He doesn’t respond, lost in the wand. McGonagall’s eyes drift to it, briefly, then study Harry’s face. She 
frowns, trying to call forth some words. 


PROFESSOR McGONAGALL 
Potter, in light of what’s happened... should you feel the need to talk to someone... 


She falters. Harry gently sets the wand back upon the desk, retraces his steps to the door, pauses for one last look. 


PROFESSOR McGONAGALL 
You should know... Professor 
Dumbledore... 



Harry turns then, studying her drawn face, no words 
necessary. At a loss, she finishes quietly: 



PROFESSOR McGONAGALL 
You meant a great deal to him. 


Harry’s eyes rise. High upon the wall, the past Headmasters snooze in their frames. The last looks 
remarkably peaceful, the trace of a smile on his lips as he sleeps. 



Dumbledore.  
Harry nods, lingering one last moment, and exits.   




140 INT. TOWER DORMITORY - DAY 140 

Harry stands at the window, alone in the empty dormitory.
At the doorway, he looks back. As if committing it to 
memory. 

141 INT. COMMON ROOM - DAY (MOMENTS LATER) 141 

Harry starts down the stairs, stops. Hermione, Ron and 
Ginny sit talking quietly. Ginny looks up. Smiles 
softly. 

142 EXT. ASTRONOMY TOWER - DAY 142 

Harry and Hermione stand by the ramparts while Ron and  
Ginny stand further along, just out of earshot. Harry  
stares into the distance at the ashes of Hagrid’s Hut.
Hermione toys with the locket before them.  

HERMIONE  

Do you think he would’ve done it.

Draco? 

HARRY 

No. He was lowering his wand. In 

the end, it was Snape. It was 

always Snape. And I did 

nothing... 

Hermione studies Harry, takes the locket from the  
rampart. 

HERMIONE  

Strange. Thinking this is a piece  

of Voldemort’s soul... 

HARRY 

Yeah, strange. Only... it’s not.  

It’s a fake.  

As Hermione reacts, Harry nods.  

HARRY
Go on. Open it.  




142 


139. 
142 
Hermione pries open the locket and removes a piece of PARCHMENT folded in a tight square. READS: 
* 
HERMIONE 
‘To the Dark Lord. I know I will 
be dead long before you read this but I want you to know that it was I who discovered your secret. I 
have stolen the real Horcrux and 
intend to destroy it as soon as I 
can. I face death in the hope that when you meet your match, you will be mortal once more. R.A.B.’ 
(looking up)
R.A.B.? 

HARRY 
Dunno. But whoever they are, they have the real Horcrux. Which 
means, it was a waste. All of it. 
Hermione studies Harry’s troubled face, then glances at Ginny and Ron. 


HERMIONE 
Ron’s okay with it, you know. 
and Ginny. But if I were you, 
when he’s around, I’d keep the snogging to a minimum. 
You 



Hermione smiles faintly, trying to cheer him, but Harry merely nods, looks away again. 


HARRY 
I’m not coming back, Hermione.  
Hermione nods.  
HERMIONE 
We reckoned --Ron and me. 


HARRY 
I have to finish what Dumbledore 
started. I’m not sure where that 
will lead me... but I’ll let you and Ron know where I am -- when I 
can. (ALT: I have to finish what 
Dumbledore started. And... I have 
to do it alone.) 



 
HERMIONE 
I’ve always admired your courage,
Harry, but sometimes... you’re really thick. 








142 


140. 
142 
Harry turns, looking at her in surprise.  
HERMIONE 
You don’t honestly think you can find all those Horcruxes by yourself, do you?
(leaning in; a 
whisper) 
You need us, Harry. 




Harry just stares at her. She cocks her head, smiling,
doing her best to coax one out of him. Finally, he does,
briefly. 




HARRY 
Yeah. I do. But do me a favor. 
When I’m around? Keep the snogging to a minimum. 




Hermione looks stunned. Reddens.  
HERMIONE 
Like that’s going to happen. 


She glances at Ron, shakes her head.  
HERMIONE 
Besides, he’s barking. 


HARRY 
Funny, he says the same about you. 


HERMIONE 
Yes, but I’m exceptionally perceptive. 



HARRY 
You’re brilliant. You both are. 


Harry looks off again and Hermione follows his gaze. She 
looks out over the grounds. Slowly losing herself. We 
can tell. She’s taking inventory. Pressing it into a scrapbook. 



HERMIONE 
Do you think we’ll ever... (comeback?) 


She stops. Her eyes glisten briefly. Then she fights it back. Tough. Harry fights back his own emotion, reaches over and gives her hand a brief squeeze. Then releases
