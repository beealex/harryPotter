What did you put on me?
How long will it last?
Luna...?
Hello, sir.
Help us.
Dobby. What’re you doing here?
Do you mean to say you can Apparate in and out of here? And take us with you?
Right. Dobby, I want you to takeLuna and Mr. Ollivander to -
You’ll see to Mr. Ollivander?
Stupefy!
Stupefy!
Give the Dark Lord our regards.
It’s all right, Hermione. You’re safe. We’re all safe.
Dobby... no...
It’s okay... Here... Just hold on, Dobby... I’ll fix you -- Hermione-- your bag --you must have something -- Essence of Dittany -- something... Hermione! Help me!
I want to bury him properly. Without magic.
I need to talk to the goblin.
How are you?
You probably don’t remember -
Yes.
Why did you leave Gringotts?
I need to get inside Gringotts, into one of the vaults.
Alone, yes. With you, no.
It’s complicated. Why did Bellatrix Lestrange think it should be in her vault at Gringotts?
The sword presented itself to us in a moment of need. We didn’t steal it.
And she never suspected?
And in Madam Lestrange’s vault as well?
I have gold. Lots of it.
The goblin twists the curl at his chin... then his eyes drift once again to the sword. Harry starts to respond, but the goblin cuts him off with finality.
All right.
She was terrified when she thought we’d been in there. She kept asking you what else we’d taken. I’d bet anything there’s a Horcrux there. If we find it, we can kill it. And if we kill it, we’re one step closer to killing him.
I’m still working on that part. FLEUR exits the room ahead, a half-empty bowl in hand. Seeing Harry, she stops, effectively barring the door.
Mr. Ollivander, I need to ask you a few questions.
Can you identify these, sir?
And this?
Was? Isn’t it still?
You talk about wands like they’ve got feelings. Can think.
What do you know about the Deathly Hallows, sir?
But you, sir? Do you believe they exist?
You’re lying. You know one exists and you told him about it. You told him about the Elder Wand and where to go looking for it.
He has found it, sir.
That’s all, sir. We’ll leave you to get some rest now.
Then I guess I’ll just have to kill him before he finds me, sir.
I reckon you should take this then.
If I can hold it, you can.
I’ll know. I can’t explain. It’s like...
... they sing to me.
No. I just know. When one’s near.
In the morning.
He’ll be leaving too.
Yeah. Funny. Listen, Luna, about your father, I don’t want you to think I -
Hogwarts?
It’s not the place you left, you know. It’s not the same.
Wouldn’t know you if I didn’t know you.
Sirius gave it to me. He had a matching piece. He said if I ever needed him, all I had to do was look into it.
Something like that. I don’t know. He died before I ever got to use it. The thing is...
You’ll think I’m mental, but more than once, when I’ve looked into it -- I think I’ve seen Dumbledore.
You can give that to Hermione to
C’mon. Let’s do it.
The door glides shut. The wind dies. Bogrod blinks.
How long before they come after us?
What is that, Griphook?
Griphook! What is that!
Well done. Hey.
You look like... you. Hermione is soaking wet and looks like... Hermione. Ron looks like Ron. Griphook nods to the waterfall.
That’s it. Up there.
Give me the sword! The real one.
We have a deal, Griphook.
Griphook! Griphook!
Come on!
We’re dropping! The dragon circles, lower and lower. A lake shimmers.
NOW!
He knows.
You-Know-Who. He knows we broke into Gringotts. He knows what we took. He knows we’re hunting Horcruxes.
I saw him.
I can’t always help it, Hermione!
Maybe I can. I don’t know.
He’s angry. But he’s scared too.
I reckon he’ll do anything to stop us from finding the rest. There’s more: one of them’s at Hogwarts.
I saw the castle. And Rowena Ravenclaw. I think it must have something to do with her. We have to go there, now.
Honestly, Hermione, when have any of our plans actually worked? We plan, we get there and all hell breaks loose.
We’ll go to Hogsmeade. To Honeydukes. Take the secret passage in the cellar.
There’s something wrong with him. In the past, I could always follow his thoughts. Now everything feels disconnected.
No. It’s more like he’s wounded. If anything, he feels more dangerous.
Expecto Patronum!

You’re Aberforth.
Dumbledore’s brother. It’s you I’ve been seeing -- here. It’s you who sent Dobby.
He’s dead.
How’d you come by it?
Dung had no right selling you that. It belonged to -ABERFORTH Sirius. Albus told me. He also told me that you’d likely be hacked off if you ever found out I had it. But ask yourself whereyou’d be if I didn’t. Harry doesn’t respond.
We need to get into Hogwarts. Dumbledore gave us a job to do. Did he now?
We’ve been hunting Horcruxes. We think the last one’s in the school. But we’ll need your help getting in.

If we can find it and kill it, then we kill him, and then we can end this war once and for all. We need to get into Hogwarts tonight. Aberforth stares at him for a moment, until the silence grows.
Dumbledore trusted me, to see this through.
Why should he...
I only care about the Dumbledore I knew. I trusted him.
I had no reason not to -

Because I need to. Because if I don’t, I don’t know who I am anymore. I’ve lost too many people to lie down now. I’m not interested in what happened between you and your brother, I don’t even care that you’ve given up. I trust the man I knew. I’m going to see this through.
I need to get into the castle tonight. Silence. HERMIONE and RON exchange a glance. ABERFORTH regards HARRY darkly, but HARRY merely stands, waiting. After several seconds, Aberforth’s gaze shifts... to the painting.
Where’ve you sent her?
Neville, you look...
The Carrows?
Okay. There’s something we need to find, something hidden here in the castle. It could help us defeat You-Know-Who.
We don’t know.
Don’t know that either.
I realize it’s not much to go on.
I think it might have something to do with Ravenclaw. It would be small, easy to conceal, valuable. Any ideas?
Hey there.
I think I can help you out with that...
It would seem that, despite your exhaustive defensive strategies, you have a bit of a security problem, Headmaster.
And I’m afraid it’s rather extensive.
How dare you stand where he stood.
Tell them how it was that night. Tell then how you looked him in the eye, a man who trusted you... and killed him. Tell them!
I’m a Gryffindor.
Time. As much as you can give me.
Is that possible, Professor?
I think you’re right.
You, too, Professor.
What’re you saying?
Okay. But take this. That way you can find me when you get back.
Ravenclaw Common Room. Got to start somewhere.
I’m a bit preoccupied right now, Luna.
We’ll talk later, Luna.
Later.
Who’ve you got in
Aren’t you coming?
It’s you...
You’re the Grey Lady, the ghost ofRavenclaw Tower.
I’m sorry. It’s Helena, isn’t it? Helena Ravenclaw. Rowena’s daughter. Luna told me.
Yes. She thought you might be able to help me.
Yes! That’s right -
Wait! Please!
But I don’t care about its powers! Honestly -
I don’t seek it for myself! You have to believe me!
I want to destroy it.
That’s what you want, isn’t it, Helena? You want it destroyed.
I’ll end your pain, Helena. Tell me where it is and I’ll destroy it, I swear, on my mother’s memory -
Tom Riddle -
He’s lied to many people -
Yes. That’s right. But I can undo that, Helena. I can destroy it once and for all. But only if you tell me where he hid it. You know where he hid it, don’t you, Helena? You just have to tell me. Please.
Trust me.
Thank you...
Thank you...
Ginny! Neville! You alright?
Luna -- ?
I could ask you the same.
I remember.
What’s wrong with the one you have?
Why didn’t you tell her?
Bellatrix. You knew it was me. But you didn’t say anything.
No. I don’t think so...
Besides, its allegiance is to me now. If you want it, you’ll have to win it back. Perhaps even kill me...
Expelliarmus!
It’s gone! We’ll never -
Well done. Let’s find Ron and get out of here.
Split up!
No, it’ll just follow us!
Here! Take one!
Wait! What about Malfoy and Blaise!
Ron, you once asked me if I thought he felt it -- Voldemort -- when we destroy a Horcrux, when we destroy a piece of his soul.
He does.
It’s the snake. She’s the last one. The last Horcrux.
No. He’ll keep her close.
I know where he is.
Give me something! Quickly! A flask! Anything.
I’m going there now.
It’s... meant to be.
There’s a reason I can... hear them -- the Horcruxes.
I think I’ve known for awhile.
I think you’ve known too. Hermione stands still, miserable.
Kill the snake. Kill the snake and then it’s just him. Then it will be over.
Once. Twice. Thrice... Harry stands for a moment and then, slowly, opens his eyes. Reacts. FOUR PEOPLE stand within the Forest: JAMES POTTER, SIRIUS BLACK, REMUS LUPIN and LILY POTTER. Lily eyes him lovingly and beckons him forth. As if in a dream, Harry drifts through the trees, stops before her.
Why are you here? All of you?
Does it hurt? Dying?
I’m sorry. I didn’t want any of you to die for me. And Remus, your son...
You’ll stay with me?
He won’t be able to see you?
Stay close to me.
You weren’t.
Sir, this, is this... I mean, forgive me, but you are dead, aren’t you, sir?
Then... I’m dead too?
Not?
But I didn’t defend myself. I let him kill me.
It’s true, isn’t it, sir? A bit of him lives in me, doesn’t it?
And you knew this? That’s why you were certain I wouldn’t die?
Professor, is that -- ?
Exactly where are we, sir?
It looks like King’s Cross station -- only a lot cleaner. And without the trains.
Sir, why didn’t you just tell me about the Deathly Hallows?
Sir -
You wanted to see Ariana again, didn’t you, sir?
I used the Stone as well, sir, only a little while ago when I entered the Forest. I saw my mum and dad, and Sirius and Lupin...
I’ve got to go back, haven’t I?
I’ve got a choice?
And where would it take me?
Voldemort’s got the Elder Wand.
And the snake lives.
And I’ve nothing to kill it with.
With all due respect, sir, I think what we need here is a miracle.
Which would be, sir?
Sir, my mother’s Patronus. It was a doe, wasn’t it? Just like Professor Snape’s. Curious, don’t you think?
Professor.
Is this real? Or has this been happening inside my head?
Confringo!
The snake! We’ve got to kill the snake!
Because I have something worth living for.
Confringo!
You were right.
When you told Professor Snape it was failing you. It will always fail you.
But what if the wand never belonged to him? What if the wand’s allegiance was to someone else? Voldemort stares at him. Confused. And suddenly, in this moment, it is Harry, beaten and bloody, who seems in control. He smiles, then presses even closer, his voice quiet, vaguely taunting:
Come on, Tom. Let’s end this the way we started it...
Together.
I told you: it’s useless to you.
Because it answers to another.
When he killed Snape, he thought the wand would become his. But the thing is... it never belonged to Snape.
It was Draco who disarmed Dumbledore that night on the Astronomy Tower. From that moment on, the wand answered to him. Until the other night...
... when I disarmed Draco.
It answers to me.
Well, it wasn’t boring, was it?
Together?
There’s nothing scary about thestrals. They’re gentle things. Anyway, you won’t be going up to school in the carriages. You’ll be going in the boats, remember?
Yes?
Albus Severus Potter. You were named after two Headmasters of Hogwarts. One of them was a Slytherin. And he was probably the bravest man I ever knew.
Then Slytherin House will have gained a wonderful wizard. But listen, if it means so much to you, you can choose Gryffindor. The Sorting Hat takes your choice into account.
Really.
Ready?
Time for the teary farewell.
They’ll torture you. Even Dudley. If they think you know where I’m going, they’ll stop at noth-
Do you have any? Magic?
Absolutely not. Besides, I’m just a waste of space. Isn’t that right, Vernon? Uncle Vernon stares hard at Harry.
Well... thanks. Harry grips Dudley’s hand, then watches his cousin turn and lope back across the lawn.

See you, Big D.
Good riddance.
I thought you were looking after the Prime Minister, Kingsley.
The Trace?
The real one...?
No! Absolutely not!
If you think I’m going to let people risk their lives for me -
This is different. Taking that. Becoming me -- no.
Blimey, Hermione!
Here.
Hagrid! We’ve got to help the others!
What was that?
Hagrid... HAGRID...!
Is no one back yet?
Are you mad...?
A grindylow!
Who did this to him?
Hedwig -- I think. She was trying to protect me --
I trust you with my life, Hagrid. I trust everyone in this room. Understood?
No one else is going to die. Not for me.
Come with me. Now.
Wedding?
I don’t care about a bloody wedding -- no matter whose it is. I have to start searching for the Horcruxes. It’s the only chance we have to beat him. And the longer we wait the stronger he gets.
Yes.
Dumbledore didn’t want anyone to know what it is we’re doing. If I tell you, I’d be betraying him.
Maybe that’s the best reason to have it. Because of everything that’s going on.
To what do we owe the pleasure, Minister?
And this would be...?
What’s this all about?
No idea.
That’s it then?
Excuse me?
You’ll forgive me, Minister. But
You mean -- But that’s brilliant -- I... don’t know what to say.
No, ’course not. How are you, Luna?
Nice to meet you, sir.
Sir? May I sit down?
I found what you wrote in theDaily Prophet very moving, sir. I take it you knew Professor Dumbledore well?
I never even knew he had a brother, sir.
Sir, I was wondering if you’d had much contact with him before he died.
Strange, sir?
Could you tell me from where they’d come, sir?
Just curious. I was... close to Professor Dumbledore.
Who are you talking about?
Who?
Oh, right. Slipped my mind...
Godric’s Hollow? Bathilda Bagshot lives in Godric’s Hollow?
Excuse me? You don’t mean to say Dumbledore lived there too?
Do you reckon everyone’s alright at the wedding? Maybe we should -
Same.
My rucksack. With all my things. I left it back at the Burrow -
You’re joking.
DOWN!
Stupefy!
Lock the door, get the lights.
This one’s name is Rowle. He was on the Astronomy Tower the night Snape killed Dumbledore.
It’s better we wipe their memories. We kill them, they’ll know we were here.
How is it they knew we were there?
Hermione. I appreciate the thought -- honestly. But given that we were almost killed by a couple of Death Eaters a few minutes ago...
I have an idea.
Mad-Eye...?

Lumos.
Yeah. They knew her. She wrote A History of Magic, you know.
I’m thinking maybe we should go talk to her. She still lives in Godric’s Hollow. I’m thinking maybe she could help us.
To the Dark Lord. I know I will be dead long before you read this... I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy it...

Stop! I order you!
Been spying on us, have you?
Ever seen this before?
Kreacher, I own this place. Sirius left it to me. Which means I own you too.
That’s right. But there were two, weren’t there?
Where’s the other one?
Answer her.
How do you mean?
Where is it now? Did someone take it, Kreacher?
Who, Kreacher? Who was it?
Find him.
You mean... it remembers me?
When you turned this place over -- don’t deny it! --you found a locket, am I right?
Who was she? This witch?
It gets really tricky.
This is completely mental.
I’m nobody.
Apparently so.
Are those...?
The Ministry must be hiring young these days.
How long did you say this batch of Polyjuice Potion would last, Hermione?
Ron. You don’t have a wife.
Look, we’ll go with you --
Ron’s been coming here since he was two years old. It’s us you should be worrying about.

I say if we don’t locate Umbridge within the hour, we go find Ron and come back another day. Deal? The grilles clang open again and Harry and Hermione freeze.
Accio locket.
Ron, it’s me.
She went down to the courtrooms with Umbridge -- The grilles open again and reveal... Arthur Weasley, in the company of an elderly witch
.
Arthur! You know you’re being tracked, don’t you?
No, Arthur. It’s a fact. They’re watching you.
I’ll tell you later. Let’s find Hermione.
It’s here...
You’re lying. And one mustn’t tell lies, Dolores... Stupefy!
EXPECTO PATRONUM!
Accio Dittany.
Hermione. His arm -
What happened? I thought we were going back to Grimmauld Place.
Don’t be stupid.
What’re you doing?
Tent? Where am I supposed to find -
They’re great.

No problem.
How bad is he?
Dumbledore had a theory. He felt that the Horcruxes would not be made out of random objects. And he felt they wouldn’t be hidden randomly either. We know of three so far. The ring, which according to Dumbledore belonged to TomRiddle’s grandfather. The diary, which belonged to Tom himself. And this, which -- again, according to Dumbledore -- belonged to his mother.
How d’you know?
I know. I felt it too.
It’s... it’s like it’s ticking or something, like it has a tiny metal heart, like it’s -
That’s why we’re going to kill it.
Dissendium!
Expulso!
We have to keep it safe until we can figure out how to destroy it.
No.
It’s not a candle I can blow out, Hermione. It always burns, even if it’s just a flicker. Can you understand that?
He’s found him. Vol-
You-Know-Who. He’s found
Yes. How’d you know?
You-Know-Who wants something Gregorovitch once had -- dunno what. But he’s desperate to have it. It’s as if his life depends on it.
Well it sets my teeth on edge. What’s he expecting to hear? Good news?
And what gets you through the day?
How long before he can travel?
You’re not doing enough.
Loads.

Snatchers.
Good to know your enchantments work.
We have to leave. We’re not safe
Then we’ll go by foot.
What?
We’re all hungry.
It’ll be dark soon. We need to find a place to sleep.
My turn.

What?
Maybe you could tell me now.
Brilliant.
O-kay.
With a basilisk fang. If you tell me you’ve got one of those in that bloody beaded bag of yours -
It only takes in that which makes it stronger...
...it can destroy Horcruxes.
You’re brilliant, Hermione. Truly.
There’s only one problem...
What’s the problem?
Look, don’t be shy. If you’ve got something to say, spit it out.
I thought you knew what you signed up for.
I don’t understand. What part of this isn’t living up to your expectations? Did you think we’d be staying in five-star hotels? Finding a Horcrux every other day? Did you think you’d be back toMummy by Christmas?
I’ve told you everything Dumbledore told me! And in case you haven’t noticed, we’ve found a Horcrux!
Yeah, he would. D’you think I haven’t noticed the two of you whispering behind my back? D’you think I haven’t guessed what you were thinking?
You think I don’t listen! You think I don’t know what it’s like -
Go then. But leave that.
Salvio Hexia... Protego Totalum...
Hermione.
You were right. It’s like you said. Snitches have flesh memories. But I didn’t catch my first Snitch with my hand. I almost swallowed it.
What do you reckon it means?
Luna’s dad was wearing that, at Ron
At Bill and Fleur’s wedding.
Around his neck. Like an amulet. I didn’t think much of it at the time. You know Luna -- she’s always got some mad thing or the other she’s carrying around. I just figured it ran in the family.
Hermione, I’ve been thinking. I -- I want to go to Godric’s Hollow. It’s where I was born, it’s where my parents died -
But it means something to him too, Hermione. You-Know-Who nearly died there. Wouldn’t that be just the kind of place he’d hide a Horcrux?
Godric’s Hollow is the birthplace of Godric Gryffindor -- I mean, ’course it is. Obvious, isn’t it?
Tossed it at Neville once when he was snoring -- might’ve popped open.
Hermione...
No. This is where I was born. I’m not returning as someone else.
Do you think they’d be in there? My mum and dad?
Is it -- ?
No.

Happy Christmas, Hermione.
Yeah.
C’mon.
We look like ordinary Muggles.
Relax. This is right. I know it.
This is where they died, Hermione.
You’re Bathilda, aren’t you?
Hermione, she knew Dumbledore. She might have the sword. Besides, she’s barely knee-high to a house-elf. I think we can overpower her if it turns ugly.
She’s gaga, remember?
Here. Let me do that.
Miss Bagshot? Who is this man?
His name. Can you tell me his name?
This is him, Hermione. The one I saw in Gregorovitch’s wand shop. The thief. Miss Bagshot, who is he?
She wants us to go upstairs.
She wants me to go. Alone.
It’s all right. You stay here.
Lumos.

Yes.

Yes.

We got away.

Are you alright?

You’ve outdone yourself this time. Hermione turns, finds Harry standing outside the tent, admiring the view. He looks pale, battle-worn.
Where are they?
Who is he, Hermione? The thief? Did Dumbledore know him?
Well?
Tell me, Hermione. Who is he?
Hermione, I don’t need to have read A History of Magic to know who Gellert Grindelwald is. Hermione nods, hands him the book, open to a PHOTOGRAPH of a TEENAGED DUMBLEDORE laughing with another BOY
. The caption: “For the Greater Good? Dark Days; Dumbledore and Grindelwald.” On the opposite page is a PHOTOGRAPH of Grindelwald in later days, clad in black, holding a JAGGED WAND -- no longer the carefree lad of youth.
Get to the hard part, Hermione.
And Dumbledore believed in it?
‘For the Greater Good.’ What does that mean?
We’re young, Hermione. And here we are, risking our lives to fight against the very thing Dumbledore supported.
Where’s my wand? I’ll take the watch.
Hermione. Where’s my wand?
It’s done.
It’s done.
Leave me yours. You get back in the warm. And give me that.
No...
Lumos!
Accio Sword.
Diffindo.
Hermione...
It was you!
And the doe. That was you as well.
My Patronus is a stag.
You didn’t see anyone else?

But I reckon whoever cast the doe, put the sword in that pool hoping we’d find it.
See that? It knows. It’s afraid.
Do it.
All the more reason.
Then why are you here? Why did you come back?
I’ll have to speak to it in order for it to open. When it does, don’t hesitate. I don’t know what’s in here, but it’ll put up a fight. The bit of Riddle that was in his diary tried to kill me.
On three. One. Two. Three.
Take me inside...
Stab it, Ron. Now.
Don’t listen to it.
Ron. Don’t listen to it!
Ron. Stab it!
We were better without you, happier without you.
Ron. It lies! Stab it! STAB IT!
Your mother confessed that she would have preferred me as a son...
Do it, Ron! Kill it!

After you left, she cried for a week. She’s like my sister.
You’ve sort of made up for it tonight. Getting the sword. Finishing off the Horcrux.
That too.

Hermione!
Fine. Actually... more than fine.
Um... I don’t know?
It’s a long story.

It’s a long story.
Exactly how did you find us?
It?
Knew what?
Keep talking ‘bout that little ball of light touching your heart -- she’ll come round.
Yeah...
Engorgio.
Reducio!
Nothing.
Sorry?
Jesus. It was there too.
Outside Gregorovitch’s wand shop. on the alley wall...
Not still mad at him, are you?
Luna.
Hello, Mr. Lovegood. I’m Harry Potter. We met a few months back?
Would it be okay if we came in? It won’t take long, sir. I promise.
Well, sir, we need some help.
What’s going on here?
Well, sir, it’s about something you were wearing around your neck at the wedding. A symbol...
Yes! Exactly. What we wondered, sir, is, well, what is it?
The what?
Yes. No.
Sorry... I still don’t really understand...

Which one would you choose if you could? Of the Deathly Hallows?
They glance at each other, amused.
Well, you could bring people back, couldn’t you? Mad-Eye. Dumbledore. Sirius. Anybody.
But I have one. The InvisibilityCloak my father left me.
And I think I’ve actually held theResurrection Stone in my hands, that night in Dumbledore’s office when he showed me the ring he’d destroyed, the Horcrux. It had a symbol on it. Now I think it was the mark of the Hallows.
Sir?
Who took her, sir?

They’ve kidnapped Luna because he supported me. He was just desperate.
They exist. The Hallows.
But he only wants the one, the last one. That’s what he’s been looking for.
He knows where it is, You-Know- Who. He’ll have it by the end of the night. He’s found the Elder Wand.
Dudley. Vernon Dudley.
The list is wrong. I told you who I am --
What did you put on me?
How long will it last?
Oh. Um. No one. Bit of a tosser.
Really.
Hey. I was wondering...
I like riding round on the trains. It takes my mind off... things.
I just Apparated, didn’t I?
Can’t imagine why...

After all these years, I just sort of roll with it, sir.
My mother’s eyes, yeah.
One of my best friends is Muggle- born. She’s the best in our year.
Sir, exactly what was that all --
It’s alright, sir. I’ll go back tomorrow, make some excuse -- Harry stops. Dumbledore is shaking his head.
But, sir. What about Hedwig? there’s my trunk -- And
Sir?
Really.
Didn’t know.
Dumbledore.
When’d you get here?
Oh come on...
But we’re talking about Hogwarts. Dumbledore. What could be safer?

Rubbish. He’s only -- what?
Amazing.
Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder?
Reckon he’s right... Harry eyes the poster of Bellatrix, her mocking half- smile. Oh no. Look.
Speaking of which... Across the avenue, DRACO MALFOY and Narcissa pause, glance around, then slip quickly down an alley.
Dunno. Let’s get closer.
I don’t know. I’m turned around.
What just happened?
Don’t you see, it was a ceremony. An initiation.
It’s happened. He’s one of them.
So what’s he doing in Borgin and Burke’s? Browsing for furniture?
Look. His father’s a Death Eater. It only makes sense. Besides, Hermione saw it. With her own eyes.
I need some air.
Luna. How’d you...?
Sorry I made you miss the carriages, Luna.
I am your friend, Luna.
Professor Flitwick, you’ve known me for five years.
Have you ever fixed one? A nose.
What the hell. Give it a go.
Well? How do I look?
Brilliant.
Later. What’ve I missed?
Thanks...
This can’t be good.
Well, you see, I’ve got an open period this morning, Professor -
It is. Or was. But I was told I had to get an Outstanding in my O.W.L. -
Really? Well... brilliant. I’ll head there straight away.
Um, sorry, sir, but I haven’t got my book yet -- nor’s Ron. You see --

Crush it. Don’t cut it.
No. Really -
Fine, sir.
I think he overestimates my abilities, sir.
Definitely.
Sir?
No! I mean... she’s brilliant. And we’re friends. But... no.
Did you know, sir? Then?
You didn’t bring ProfessorSlughorn back simply to teachPotions, did you, sir?
You said Professor Slughorn would try to collect me.
Do you want me to let him?

All right! Queue up! Excuse me...
Thanks. All right. This morning I’ll be putting you all through a few drills to assess your strengths. But know this: Just because you made the team last year does not guarantee you a spot this year. Is that clear?
All right. Cormac. Ron. It’s down to you two for Keeper. We’ll decide it with a shootout. Demelza, you’ll bring the Quaffle up against Cormac. Ginny, you’ll take on Ron.
Quiet! I’m Captain. We do it my way. Now line up. On three. One. Two... Three!

C’mon, Ron...
Ever heard of this spell?


No.
It’s... old. The binding is fragile.
I didn’t say I wasn’t curious. And, by the way, I don’t sleep with it.
-The library.
And?
Good. That settles it then.

Who’s up for a Butterbeer?
No. Over here.
No, no. Sit next to me.
Hello, sir. Wonderful to see you.
So what brings you here, sir?
I’d consider it an honor, sir.
Dumbledore asked me to... get to know him.
Dunno. But it must be important. Otherwise Dumbledore wouldn’t ask.
There’s no time!

She was cursed, wasn’t she? I know Katie. Off the Quidditch pitch she wouldn’t hurt a fly. If she was bringing that to someone, she wasn’t doing it knowingly.
It was Malfoy.
I... just... know.
What does she see in him? Dean?
You called him a slick git not five hours ago.

I suppose.
I don’t know. She’s smart. Funny. Attractive... Attractive?
She’s... got nice skin.
Well, no. I mean... I’m just saying it could be a contributing factor.
I’ve never really thought about it. But I suppose, yeah. Very nice.
I think I’ll be going to sleep now.
What?
Sorry, sir, I was just admiring your hourglass.
I think I’ll be going.
The shelf, sir?
I don’t really know how to answer that, sir.
Did Voldemort ever make the shelf, sir?
You knew him, didn’t you, sir? Tom Riddle. You were his teacher.
What was he like?
I’m sorry, sir. Forgive me. He killed my parents, you see...
Have it your way. Juice?
Dunno what you’re talking about.

Yep. Apparently it’s his lucky day.
Yeah. I suppose I could’ve just used, I dunno... a Confundus charm?
Ah. Well... they’re really good.
It feels like this.
Have you?
I just thought, you know, since neither one of us can take who we’d really like... maybe we’d go together. As friends.
So who are you taking?
Really...?

But I am the Chosen One.

Okay. Kidding. I’ll just ask someone I like. Someone cool.
Neville...?
What’re you doing?
And what’s happened to you?
Cormac! That’s who you invited!
I think she went to powder her nose.
Dragon balls.
I think I should rejoin the party, sir. My date...
A message...?
Traveling? Where?
Positive. Why?
I’d worked that much out for myself, funnily enough.
Lovely.
I’ll take your word for it.
So what happens? If you break anUnbreakable Vow?
Draco’s plotting something, I know it, something to do withVoldemort. He’s been given a task or a mission -- and Snape was offering to help.
I know it sounds mad -
That’s not what it sounded like.
But Dumbledore can make mistakes. He’s said it himself -
I’m not -
It’s good.

Are you alright, Mr. Weasley?

Did you get my owl?
Go on.
A Vanishing Cabinet?
What happened to it? The one at Borgin & Burkes?
Soon.

I know who I am, Hermione, alright?
Sorry.
If Dumbledore’s traveling places, it’s news to the Ministry. But get this: that night at Borgin & Burkes? It seems Draco was looking at a Vanishing Cabinet.
You tell me.

Who could tell the difference?
I don’t understand -- what happened?
But why would he tamper with his own memory?
Why indeed.
I don’t know him that well, sir --
Well, sir, I wondered if I might ask you something.
Well, you see, the other day I was in the Restricted Section -- in the library -- and I stumbled upon something rather odd while reading. Something about a bit of rare magic...
I’m not sure... That is, I don’t recall the name... exactly. But it got me wondering... Are there some kinds of magic you’re not allowed to teach?

Yes, well, we don’t exactly see eye-to-eye, sir. What I mean to say is, he’s not like you. He might... misunderstand.

Did you say the same to Tom Riddle, sir? When he came asking questions.

Sir --

Nice.
Hermione. I think Malfoy’s leaving the castle.

I’ve seen it. Sometimes... sometimes he just disappears off the Map.
The Map is never wrong.

Divine. Had ourselves a little late-night snack, did we?
Or twenty.
Really? Honestly, I reckoned she was starting to annoy you.
Excuse me?

Well... Brilliant.
Bloody well hope so. She’s been snogging you for three months.
Who’re you talking about?
Okay. Very funny.

What the hell was that for?
Okay! Fine! You’re in love with her! Have you ever actually met her!
Ron, these chocolates, they’re -- C’mon. I’m going to introduce you to Romilda Vane.
Devastatingly handsome.

Sir. I’m sorry. I wouldn’t bother you if it weren’t absolutely --
I figured this called for a more practiced hand, sir.
I’m sorry, sir. About the other day. Our... misunderstanding.
I mean, I’m sure you’re tired of it, after all these years. The questions. About... Voldemort.
Yes, sir. It’s just, well, Dumbledore once said that fear of a name only increases fear of the thing itself. It seemed sensible.
Love potion.
Ron! Ron!!! Professor, help him!
Professor! Do something!!

He’s choking!!

Breathe! C’mon, Ron, don’t be a prat. Breathe! BREATHE!

How are you, Katie?
SECTUMSEMPRA!
The Room of Requirement... Ginny nods, turns away. Harry follows.
Who showed you this? First.
What was that?
What?
Oh. Yeah.
Say that again.
Excellent. Really excellent.
Right. I’m going down to Hagrid’s.
No. I’ve got a good feeling about going to Hagrid’s. I feel like it’s the place to be tonight, know what I mean?
Trust me. I know what I’m doing. Or at least Felix does.
Sorry, sir. I should’ve announced myself. Cleared my throat. Coughed. You probably feared I was Madam Sprout.
Just the general behavior, sir. The sneaking around. The jumping when you saw me. By the way, those Tentacula leaves -- they’re quite valuable, aren’t they?
Personally, these plants have always kind of freaked me out.

Through the front doors, sir. I’m off to Hagrid’s, you see. He’s a very dear friend and I felt like paying him a visit. So if you don’t mind, I’ll be going.
Sir?
Well, then by all means come along, sir.
That would be counterproductive, sir.
No idea.
A dead one, I think, sir.
Not to mention the pincers.
Through the front doors.
Oh yeah.
Poof.
Do you know why I survived? The night I got this.
Because of her. Because she sacrificed herself. Because she refused to step aside. Because her love was more powerful than Voldemort.
I’m not afraid of the name, Professor. And I’m not afraid of him. And you shouldn’t be either. She didn’t just die for me that night. She died for you too. She died for everyone who’s ever woken in the middle of the night afraid a Death Eater waited on their doorstep.
Professor. I’m going to tell you something, something others have only guessed at. It’s true. I am the Chosen One.
Only I can kill him. But in order to do so, I need to know what Tom Riddle asked you that night in your office all those years ago. And I need to know what you told him.
Be brave, Professor. Be brave like my mother. Otherwise you disgrace her. Otherwise she died for nothing. Otherwise, the bowl remains empty forever.
Sir -
Do you mean to say he succeeded, sir? In making a Horcrux?
Seven. He made seven -- the most powerfully magical number. But... what are they exactly?
Tom Riddle’s diary -
And the ring...?
But if you could find them all. If you did destroy each Horcrux...
But how would you find them? They could be hidden anywhere, couldn’t they...
It’s where you’ve been going, isn’t it, sir? When you leave the school.
Hermione, is the Room of Requirement unplottable?
It would explain why I thought Malfoy was leaving the castle when he disappeared off the Map.
He was going to the Room of Requirement.
But I’m telling you. I saw it --

What if there are two? Vanishing cabinets.
I don’t know...

I don’t need luck. I’ll be with Dumbledore.
You look the same to me, sir.
Yes, sir.
My word.
Sir, I thought one couldn’t Apparate within Hogwarts.
It’s there, isn’t it?
Sir!

You should’ve let me, sir.
We couldn’t, perhaps, just try a Summoning Charm, sir?
Accio Horcrux!
Sir... have you ever taken Felix Felicis?
Professor... there are bodies in this lake.
Do you think the Horcrux is in there, sir?
Why can’t I drink it, sir?
Professor?
Professor? Can you hear me?
You... you can’t stop, Professor. You’ve got to keep drinking. Like you said. Remember.
It will, sir. It’ll stop. But only if you drink...
What?
No...
One more. Just one more. And then -- I promise... I’ll do what you say.
I promise.
Aguamenti.
You did it, sir. Look -
I’m trying, sir. I’m -
Don’t worry, sir. We’re nearly there.
We need to get you up to the hospital, sir, to Madam Pomfrey -
All right. Okay.
Sir, are you... praying?
Cruciatus!

Incacerata!

Impedimenta!

Fight! Fight back, you coward!

Sectumsempra!

Hagrid... HAGRID!

Hagrid! You alright?
Hagrid, Dumbledore -
No. He was lowering his wand. In the end, it was Snape. It was always Snape. And I did nothing...

Yeah, strange. Only... it’s not. It’s a fake.

Go on. Open it.

Dunno. But whoever they are, they have the real Horcrux. Which means, it was a waste. All of it.

I’m not coming back, Hermione. Hermione nods.
I have to finish what Dumbledore started. I’m not sure where that will lead me... but I’ll let you and Ron know where I am -- when I can.

Yeah. I do. But do me a favor. When I’m around? Keep the snogging to a minimum.

Funny, he says the same about you.
You’re brilliant. You both are.

I don’t know.

Hermione. Bad dream. When did you get here?
Last night.
Where are we actually going?
Yes sir. This way.
Pleasure to meet you too sir.
Why are they all standing around that manky old boot?
What's a 'portkey'?
Thanks.
See ya later Cedric.

I love magic.
What is THAT?
Crime?
What crime?
Those people tonight, in the masks... they're his too aren't they? they're his followers.
There was a man. Before. There.
I dunno. I didn't see his face.
It's alright I'll get it.
Oh no thank you I'm not hungry.
I'm fine.
Well there's something you don't see every day.
I don't know but I don't think it's Pumpkin Juice.
Yeah well rather you than me.
No sir.
No sir.
Yes sir.
Let you know what?
I didn't ask for this to happen Ron. Okay? You're being stupid.
I didn't put my name in that cup. I don't WANT eternal glory I just wanna be.. Look, I don't know what happened tonight and I don't know why, it just did ok.
It's a broomcupboard.
Oh, no.
I'm fourteen.
I dunno I haven't really thought about it.
Fourteen.
No I didn't enter.

Hey, my eyes aren't glistening with the ghosts of my past.
AGH!
Sirius?
Sirius?! How...
No!
I dunno.
No. Umm.. Voldemort was giving him a job to do. Something important.
He wanted... me. I dunno why, but he was gonna use this man to get to me. I mean it was only a dream right?
What are you saying?
Do you think one of them put my name in the goblet?
I'm not ready for this Sirius.
Someone's coming!
Who says I was talking to anyone.
Maybe you're imagining things, wouldn't be the first time.
Neville! You're doing it again!

Magical water plants of the highland Lochs?
Is that right? Well.... what?
Well you can tell Ronald...
Yeah I brought the cloak. Hagrid where are we going?
What's with the flower? Hagrid have you combed your hair?
Dragons? That's the first task? You're joking.
Ron was here?
No he didn't. He didn't tell me a thing.
Thanks.
Excuse me..

Can I have a word?
Dragons. That's the first task. They've got one for each of us.
Yes.
Don't worry about it.

You're a right foul git you know that?
I know so.
Yeah. Stay away from me.
I don't give a damn what you or your father thinks Malfoy. He's vile and cruel, and you're just pathetic.
Oh... um... You know I just thought I'd...
Um... I dunno.. I can fly. I mean I'm a fair flyer.
But I'm not allowed a broom.
Yeah.
Battle a dragon.
The horntail...
Nothing.
Who wants me to open it? You want me to open it?
What the bloody hell was that?
Caught on have you. Took you long enough.
Brilliant. That makes me feel loads better.
Hagrid warned me about the dragons.
Who could possibly figure that out? That's completely mental.
Well it does match your eyes. Is there a bonnet?

Oi! Never gonna let him forget this are you?
Why do they always have to travel in packs? How are you supposed to get one alone to ask them...
I think I'd take the dragon right now.
But then again he can take himself.
Agreed.
Cho!
Ok thanks. Cho?
Um.
I just wondered if maybe you wanted to go to the ball with me?
Um. I was just wondering if maybe you wanted to go to the ball with me.
Ok. Great. Fine. No problem. Good.
What happened to you?
What did she say?
Don't be silly.
What did you do then?
Hey!
My dress robes.
Well I expect yours are more traditional.
Leave it alone.
Who?
Because we'd take the mickey out of her if she did.
Ready professor?
No.
Yeah she does.
What?
Really? I had no idea. I suppose Viktor's already figured it out.
What's that supposed to mean?
Cedric.
Spectacular.
Forget about it. I'm sure you would have done the same for me.
I must be out of my mind.
Myrtle!
Polyjuice potion! Kicked the habit. Myrtle, did you say try putting it in the water?
Myrtle, there aren't Merpeople in the black lake are there?
Come seek us where our voices sound.
An hour long you'll have to look.
Potentially problematic? When was the last time you held your breath under the water for an hour Hermione?
Neville. No offense, but I really don't care about plants. Now if there's a Tibetan turnip that will allow me to breathe underwater for an hour then great.
You're sure about this Neville.
For an hour.
Most likely?
You're telling me this now? You must be joking.
Well that makes you sight better than Ron and Hermione. Where are they anyway?
Do I?
But she's my friend too!
Hermione
I finished last Hermione.
Mr Crouch?
I can come back later Professor.
Agh!
Professor?
Sir, Mr Crouch's son, what happened to him?
It's just that I had a dream about him. It was in the summer, before school. In the dream I was in a house and Voldemort was there only he wasn't quite human, and Wormtail was there too and Mr Crouch's son.
Yes. Always the same one. Sir... these dreams, what I see, you don't think it's actually happening do you?
Yes sir.
Bubble juice sir?
I haven't stolen anything.
Fleur? Fleur!
No stop! He's bewitched Cedric.
He's bewitched!
For a moment so did I.
Some game.
Together, on three. One, two, three!
Yeah, you?
I've been here before.
I've been here before in a dream. Cedric, we have to get back to the cup? Now!
Get back to the cup!
Cedric!
Don't touch him.
Have it your way.
He's back, he's back! Voldemort's back. Cedric, he asked me to bring his body back. I couldn't leave him, not there.
Not so much now.
The cup was a portkey. Someone had bewitched it.
Who?
I dunno. It was like I'd fallen into one of my dreams. One of my nightmares.
Um. I don't think I said anything about a graveyard Professor.
It was you from the beginning. You put my name in the goblet of fire. You bewitched Krum. But...
That's Moody, but then who's...?
Professor, when I was in the graveyard there was a moment... um... when Voldemort's wand and mine sort of connected.
No I don't think so.
Yes.
Yeah. Every week.
I can't, Hedwig. I'm not allowed to use magic outside of school. Besides, if Uncle Vernon -- At the sound of the name, HEDWIG SQUAWKS again, LOUDER.
Now you've done it.
She's bored. If I could just let her out for an hour or two --
But I haven't gotten any messages. From any of my friends. Not one. All summer.
I'll be in my bedroom, making no noise and pretending I don't exist.
What... Who are you?
I see. Not to be rude or anything, but this isn't a great time for me to have a house-elf in my bedroom.
Why don't you sit down?
Shhhh! I'm sorry. I didn't mean to offend you or anything --
You can't have met many decent wizards then. Dobby shakes his head, then without warning, LEAPS off the bed and starts to BANG HIS HEAD FURIOUSLY ON THE FLOOR.
Are you... all right?
Your... family?
Not go back? But... I have to.
What terrible things? Who's plotting them? Dobby makes a funny CHOKING and GAGGING noise.
Okay! I understand. You can't say -- Too late. Dobby grabs the bedside lamp and starts beating himself about the head and YELPING LOUDLY.
Stop! Stop! FOOTSTEPS THUNDER on the landing. Quickly, Harry grabs Dobby by the pillowcase and pitches him into the wardrobe... just as the door FLINGS OPEN.
See why I've got to go back? I don't belong here. I belong in your world -- at Hogwarts. It's the only place I've got... friends.
Well, I expect they've been -- hang on, how do you know my friends haven't been writing me? Guiltily, Dobby takes out a STACK of LETTERS.
Give me those. Now. Dobby frowns sadly, then DASHES out the door. Panicking...
Dobby... Please... No...
I can't. Hogwarts is my home.
'Dear Mr. Potter. We have received intelligence that a Hover Charm was used at your place of residence at twelve minutes past seven this evening. As you know, underage wizards...'
Well done, Dudley. Finally learned the days of the week, have you.
It's no good turning your beak up. It's all we've got. Harry feeds a piece of bread to Hedwig... as we...

Ron?
Fred? George? What're you doing here?
Hedwig! Harry clambers back, grabs Hedwig's cage, swings it onto the ledge, when... BAM! The bedroom door CRASHES OPEN.
I think it's... brilliant! Ron looks up. Sees Harry's mesmerized face. Slowly...GRINS.

Raids?
The Misuse of Muggle Artefacts...?
Diagon Alley!
Floo Powder? Just then, Ron's older brother PERCY enters.

D-Dia-gon Alley!
I'm fine, thanks. I'm just --
Hagrid!

I was lost, I -- Hang on. What were you doing down there?
I need to remember that one.
Who?
Thank you.

You have these. I'll buy my own --
He was a murderer.
His name is Voldemort.

Sorry. Lost control of the trolley.
Why can't we get through?
The train leaves at exactly eleven o'clock. We've missed it.
Maybe we should go wait by the car.
This is mad. We can't drive to Hogwarts.
You don't mean -- Ron, no.
Something tells me we're going to regret this.
No offense, Ron, but are you sure you know how to fly this.
Uh, Ron. I should tell you. Most Muggles aren't accustomed to seeing a flying car.
There! Up ahead! Look...

Do you hear that?

Aaaahhhhh!

I'm trying! Your hand's all sweaty!

I think we found the train.
Just out of interest, Ron. Have you ever landed a car before?
UP! UP!

MIND THAT TREE!

TURN! TURN!

Be thankful it's not your neck.

Aaaaahhhhh!

Aaaaahhhhh!


Reverse! Reverse!

A house elf shows up in my bedroom, we can't get through the barrier to Platform Nine and Three Quarters, we almost get killed by a tree... clearly someone doesn't want me here this year.
Professor Dumbledore. Professor McGonagall...
Mr. Filch. You dropped this...

You're doomed.

Hello, Colin. Nice to meet --
Look at it this way. How much worse can things get?
'What is Gilderoy Lockhart's favorite color?'
'When is Gilderoy Lockhart's birthday and what would his ideal gift be?'
Hands on? Hermione, he didn't have a clue what he was doing.
Draco?
Get out of the way, Colin!
Let's take him to Hagrid. He'll know what to do.
Malfoy. He called Hermione, well, I don't know exactly what it means...
That's horrible.
What?
No... not you, that... voice.
That... voice. Didn't you hear it?
Spooky.
Did you hear it?
That... voice.

I heard it first in Lockhart's office and then again, just --
It's moving. I think it's going to... kill.

That's Filch's cat. Mrs. Norris.

It's not true, sir! I swear! I never touched Mrs. Norris -- And I don't even know what a Squib is.
When I said I wasn't hungry. We were heading back to the Common Room and... found Mrs. Norris.

Yes.
He said he didn't.
You do believe me, don't you?
I can't explain it -- it was... scary.
D'you think I should've told them -- Dumbledore and the others, I mean.
But if there really is a Chamber of Secrets, and it's really been opened, that means...
Maybe Ron's right, Hermione. I mean, look at his family. The whole lot of them have been in Slytherin for centuries.
How long will it take to make?
A month? But if Malfoy is the heir of Slytherin... he could attack half the Muggle-borns in the school by then.
No... no... not you.
Dobby!

It was you! You stopped the barrier from letting Ron and me through!
You nearly got Ron and me expelled!
Your Bludger? You made that Bludger chase after me?
You'd better clear off before my bones come back, Dobby, or I might strangle you!
I don't suppose you could tell me why you're trying to kill me?
Why do you wear that thing, Dobby?
Repeat itself? You mean, this has happened before?

Tell me, Dobby? When did this happen before? Who's doing it now?
Who is it? No, Dobby! Tell me!

Nice to meet you. I'm --

I wouldn't bet on that.
Who cares?
You wish.

Rictusempra!


Leave him!


LEAVE HIM!

I'm a what?
I know. I mean, I accidentally set a python on my cousin Dudley at the zoo once. But so what? I bet loads of people here can do it.
What's bad? If I hadn't told that snake not to attack Justin --
You were there! You heard me!
I spoke a different language? But I didn't realize -- how can I speak a language without knowing I can?
But I'm not. I... can't be.
Who am I, Hedwig? What am I?
Hagrid... what're you doing here?
It's nothing. I'd better get going. I've got a lot of studying...
Professor, I swear I didn't --
Well, you see, I was wondering...
You're wrong!

Professor, your bird... I couldn't do anything... He just caught fire.
You don't think it was me, Professor?
No, Professor. Nothing.
He's the only one.
Maybe they're right.

I didn't know I could speak Parseltongue. What else don't I know about myself? Maybe you can do something... even something horrible... and not know you did it.
Crabbe and Goyle.
Ron?
We still sound like ourselves. You need to sound more like Crabbe.
Lower.
Less intelligent.
Excellent.
Hermione, are you okay?
You're wrong!
Harry Potter.
Then you must have some idea who's behind it all?
Hermione, come out. We've got loads to tell you!
Nothing.
Neville asked to borrow a tubeworm in Potions yesterday. I suppose that's something.

Looks like Myrtle's flooded the bathroom.

Why would I throw something at you?
Who threw it at you anyway?
This is a diary. And it's old...
I'll take my chances...
Ahhh! MY EYES! MY EYES!

Ginny! I was only joking -- Brilliant. Even your sister thinks I'm the monster now.
That's odd. He never wrote in it.
Special Services to the School or something --
Yes. Why?
Fifty years ago! That means --
That's a brilliant theory, Hermione. With just one tiny little flaw. There's nothing written in this diary.
You don't think I'm dangerous, do you, Hermione? I mean, you're not scared. Of me.
Do... you... know... anything... about... the... Chamber... of... Secrets?

Can... you... tell... me?



Excuse me. Could you tell me where I am? Hello...?

Ron! Ron!
It was Hagrid. Hagrid opened the Chamber of Secrets fifty years ago.
The monster had killed someone, Ron. What would any of us done?
No!

What's that you've got, Hagrid?
And they found it... Tom Riddle's diary is gone.
What do you understand!

The library?
We've got to talk to Hagrid, Ron. I can't believe it's him. But if he did set the monster loose last time -- even by accident -- he'll know how to get inside the Chamber of Secrets. And that's a start.
I think it's time to get my Dad's old Cloak out again.
What's that for?
Are you okay? Hagrid? Did you hear about Hermione?
Look... we have to ask you something. Do you know who's opened the Chamber of Secrets?

Look...

C'mon.
You heard Hagrid. Follow the spiders.
There's something moving over there... something big.

It's been here all the time! Look at it. The Forest has turned it wild.

C'mon, we don't want to lose the trail.
Don't panic. As Harry steps to the mouth of the cavern, the AIR suddenly CRACKLES with MOVEMENT. TWIGS SNAP. A HUGE SHADOW emerges, slowly engulfs Harry. He peers up. SEES: An ANCIENT SPIDER
, the size of a small elephant. As it advances, Harry and Ron back slowly away. Then: its BLIND EYES catch the light, and it STOPS. As if... listening.

Yes. We're friends of Hagrid's. And you... you're...
... Aragog, aren't you?

He's in trouble. Up at school, there've been attacks. They think it's Hagrid. They think he's opened the Chamber of Secrets. Like before.

But if Hagrid never... that means... you're not the monster.
Shhh!
But if you're not the monster, what did kill that girl fifty years ago?
But have you seen it?


What!

Well... thank you. We'll just go...
Let's go!

THE WINDOWS! ROLL UP THE WINDOWS!
Don't mention it.

That way! It's the only way out!
Hurry! They're catching up!

Can you get us in the air?
We know one thing. Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets. He was innocent.
Wish you were here, Hermione. We need you. Now more than ever...

'Of the many fearsome beasts that roam our land, none is more deadly than the Basilisk. Capable of living for hundreds of years, instant death awaits any who meet this giant serpent's eye. Spiders flee before it and only the crowing of the rooster can kill it.'
Ron! This is it! The monster in the Chamber of Secrets is a Basilisk. That's why I can hear it speak. It's a snake.
Because no one did look it in the eye. Not directly at least...
Colin saw it through his camera. Justin -- Justin must've seen the Basilisk through Nearly Headless Nick! Nick got the full blast of it, but he's a ghost -- he couldn't die again...
... And Hermione... had the mirror! I bet you anything she was using it to look round corners, in case it came along.
The water... there was water on the floor that night. She only saw the Basilisk's reflection...
The crowing of the rooster is fatal to it! That's why Hagrid's roosters were killed! Spiders flee before it! It all fits!
Hermione answered that too.

Remember what Aragog said? About that girl fifty years ago? She died in a bathroom. What if she never left.

C'mon. Let's go see Lockhart. He may be a brainless git, but he's going to try and get into the Chamber. We can tell him what we know...
We'll find her, Ron. Ginny's going to be fine.

Professor, we've got some information for you --

Are you going somewhere?
You're running away? After all that stuff you did in your books?
You wrote them!
You're a fraud! You've just been taking credit for what a load of other wizards have done!
Expelliarmus!

Looks like those Dueling Lessons came in handy after all, Professor.
To ask you how you died.
Who was it, Myrtle?
Just like that? How?
This is it, Ron. This is the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets.
Open up.

Oh, yes there is. You first.

All right. Let's go.
Thanks, Myrtle.

Lumos!

Remember. Any sign of movement, close your eyes straight away.

Maybe it's asleep.

Ron? Are you okay?
Wait here. I'll go on. I'll go on and... find Ginny. If I'm not back in an hour... He leaves it there.
See you in a bit.


Open.

Ginny! Please don't be dead. Wake up! Wake up! Ginny!
Tom... Tom Riddle? What d'you mean, she won't wake? She's not...
Are you a ghost?
She's cold as ice. You've got to help me, Tom. There's a basilisk --
Give me my wand, Tom.
Listen, we've got to go! We've got to save her!
But she's dying!
No... she couldn't -- she wouldn't.
But... Why?...

And why did you want to meet me?
Hagrid's my friend. And you framed him, didn't you?
I'll bet Dumbledore saw right through you.
Well, you haven't finished it this time. In a few hours Mandrake Draught will be ready and everyone who was petrified will be all right again.
Ginny stole the diary from my room? But why?
Like what?
Why do you care how I escaped? Voldemort was after your time.
You. You're the heir of Slytherin. You're Voldemort?
Albus Dumbledore is the greatest sorcerer in the world!
He'll never be gone! Not as long as those who remain are loyal to him!

Fawkes.


Don't look. Don't look into its eyes.

Ginny. You need to get yourself out... Follow the chamber... You'll find Ron...

You were brilliant, Fawkes. I just... wasn't quick enough.

Of course. Dumbledore told me. Phoenix tears have healing powers.
It's all right, Ginny. It's over. It's just a memory...
Where's Lockhart?

I think... I think he's telling me he can take us out of here.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.

Thank you, sir.
It's just, you see, sir, I couldn't help noticing certain things. Certain similarities. Between Tom Riddle and me.
Voldemort put a bit of himself in me?
So the Sorting Hat was right. I should be a Slytherin.
Only because I asked it to.
'Godric Gryffindor.'
Dobby! This is your Master? The family you serve is the Malfoys!

Sir? I wonder if I could have that.

Mr. Malfoy! I have something of yours.

I think you do, sir. I think you slipped it into Ginny Weasley's cauldron that day in Diagon Alley.

Just promise me something.
Never try to save my life again.

With loads of help from you.

There's no Hogwarts without you, Hagrid.
Big D? Cool name, but to me, you'll always be Ikkle Duddicums.
What?
Shut up, Dudley. I'm warning you...
Because if you don't I'll turn you into the idiot pig you are!
Not so brave now, are you Duddykins? Now tell your little friends to go away. Dudley quivers, then finally complies.
Don't you ever speak about that again. You understand?
I SAID, DO YOU UNDERS'IAND?!
Quiet! The stars go out, plunging them into darkness. Dudley yells in fear. Harry turns to the end of the street. Gliding as smooth as death over the street, tattered robes drifting in the wind, comes a DEMENTOR.
Dudley! Run!
Come on!
Dudley, no!
Lumos!
'Expecto Patronum!'
Dementors. Petunia kneels on the ground next to Dudley.
No. Vernon shoves a large finger at Harry.
We were attacked.
They're evil. If they get the chance, they'll suck your soul out through your mouth.
You can't give a Dementor the 'ol one-two.'
Because I used magic to save his life! The street-lights die, plunging the street into darkness.
Lumos!
Nox.
What are you doing here?
How'd he know? It just happened!
What's been going on? What's Lord Vol- Three of the advanced guard jump.
How are we getting there?
Uh, is that very likely?
Expecto--!
No!
But I can help!
Was that your--?
But...why here?
Mrs. Weasley!
Right.
Yeah, real safe. Attacked by Dementors, that's safe, that is.
So, why's he keeping me in the dark? Hermione and Ron look awkward.
Didn't you bother asking?
So I get to spend the summer with the Dursleys while you two are here.
You've still been here! Hermione and Ron are looking aghast at Harry. Harry looks away. There is a silence.
What's been going on?
What's this Order everyone's talking about?


I'm not really hungry. I think I'll go to bed.
I wanted to, but I didn't think you'd tell me anything.

Yeah.
Where's Voldemort? What's he doing?
How?
And what's his plan?
And you're stopping him from gaining followers?
But...why?
But you're telling people, right? Sirius laughed.
What?
What kind of weapon? Lupin and Sirius exchange looks.
No, my scar kept hurting.
Yeah...nerves...
Thanks, Hermione.
Bye. He waves, and he and MR WEASLEY depart. EXT. LONDON STREET - DAY The street is not very crowded, as the sun rises in the east.
Department of Mysteries?
I've been there before...
Er...sorry.
Yes.
Yes, but-
Yes, but-
Yes.
But I did it because of the Dementors!
My cousin and I were attacked by Dementors. That's why I had to use the Patronus, to drive them away.
It's the truth!
I think so, yeah.
Er...is Percy mad at you?
What are you doing here?
If he wanted to talk to the Minister, why down here?
Yeah...just...my scar...the pain is getting stronger. Sirius gives a worried glance to Lupin, who looks grim. INT. BEDROOM - DAY Harry sits on his bunk, thinking. Sirius enters the room, but Harry barely reacts, still gazing into space.
My parents. He watches the picture for a long second.
I miss them, Sirius...
Why'd they have to die, Sirius, why?
Thanks.
Who..who was that?
I'm sure. Nothing.
So...congratulations Ron, Hermione...
Yes, do go enjoy yourselves.
What is that?

That...that...thing!
Yes it is, it's right there! He points. Ron shakes his head.
Er...you are?
Well, thanks Luna.
Hagrid's cabin looks deserted.
Yeah, could be. Moments later the carriages halt, and the students pile out.
What?
Why?
What did I do?
Where'd she get that from?
So...she believes this stuff?
But...but you believe me, don't you? Seamus looks away. Harry turns and storms out of the DORM. EXT. HOGWARTS - NIGHT Harry sits on the top of the ASTRONOMY TOWER, looking out over the LAKE and the FORBIDDEN FOREST in the distance, Hagrid's hut dark and forboding at the edge of the FOREST.
No one believes me, Hedwig. No one...
I'm alone... Hedwig takes off into the night, flying over the castle. DISSOLVE
Sorry, Professor...
What good's theory in the real world?
What about Lord Voldemort? The whole class flinched at the sound of the name.
So, according to you, Cedric Diggory dropped dead? Or are you calling me a murderer?
It was MURDER! I saw it happen!
Yeah, talk to somebody who cares. Voldemort killed Cedric, and you know it.
Yeah. But she called me a liar!
Yes, Professor.
Oh! Sorry...
I'll never get out of it, Angelina.
Later, I've got detention.
Thanks.
There's no ink.
No, I haven't.

Uh huh.
Another night, another detention.
No. Can't give...Umbridge the satisfaction...
She is. But the quill has some sort of spell on it. It uses blood for ink.
No, I'm telling anyone.
No!
I don't need his help. I don't need anyone's help. He pushes past them and limps up into the boys' dorm.
I've asked Sirius about it.
Don't worry, Hermione, I wrote it in code. Anyway, I figured I need to tell someone about Umbridge. My scar hurt again last night in detention.
Well, it's a possibility, isn't it? Hermione looks dubious.
Yeah, but Dumbledore didn't have a choice, did he? She'd been sent here by the Ministry. Hermione unfurls a copy of the Daily Prophet.
Sturgis Podmore?
You go on without me. I want to send this. They part ways.
Hedwig!

Yeah, my friend Ron Weasley. She ties the package to the owl.
Well, he made the team. I missed the tryouts. She lets go of the owl and it flies out the window.
Yeah...well, it was the truth. The owlry door bursts open again. ARGUS FILCH charges in.
What?
You're too late, it's gone. Filch looks furious.
No.
Yeah, it doesn't make any sense.
Yeah, that does seem weird. You figure its Umbridge?
Get bent, Malfoy!
It's your first practice. Don't worry about it. Ron looks unusually pale.
Yeah. Its just...the pain's getting stronger. Ron and Hermione exchange glances.
Yeah, that's true.
I don't know...
Read it.
Well, if you want to, ah, "break ties" with me, I swear I won't get violent. Ron tears the letter in half.
Sirius?
Letter from Percy.
Why?
What does he think Dumbledore is going to do, raise an army?
What do you know about Umbridge?
Could she be a Death Eater?
But she's evil.
You're kidding!
"Dreamt I was at breakfast eating oatmeal"?
Er...
Where are we going, Hermione?
Hermione, what's going on?
You mean about us teaching ourselves?
Hey, Neville.
Uh...same to you, Luna. Hermione beats on the table to quiet everyone.
That's the first time you've said his name. Hermione looks pleased.
It's okay, Hermione. He looks at the crowd.
I believe Voldemort's back because I fought him last year. Dumbledore's already told the school that. If you didn't believe him you won't believe anyone. There is a tense silence.
Me?
Uh...well, yeah, I did.
That might work. I'll look into that.
Yeah.

What about her?
What's she done now?
"By order of the Hogwarts High Inquisitor: All student organizations, societies, teams, groups, and clubs are henceforth disbanded. Permission to reform must be approved by High Inquisitor Umbridge. No student organization can exist without the knowledge and approval of the High Inquisitor. Any student found to be a part of an illegal organization will be expelled immediately." Angelina is furious just looking at it again.
Not only that, but what about the D.A.?
This isn't a coincidence. He looks at Ron and Hermione.
She knows.
Look, we don't know how many people could have overheard our meeting and told her.
What would we do without you, Hermione? She beams at him.

It's Hedwig. I think she's been attacked.
London. He gives her a significant look. She nods.
Yes, Professor.
Dobby! What are you doing here?
What is it, Dobby.
Don't worry about it, Dobby. But I don't think you can help me. Dobby's ears droop.
Actually, there is something you can do, Dobby. Dobby brightens instantly.
I need a room where twenty-eight people can practice Defense Against the Dark Arts without the teachers knowing. Especially Professor Umbridge. Dobby leaps into the air and claps his hands.
That's brilliant, Dobby! Dobby looks pleased.
Better not, Dobby. School is pretty intense right now. We'll do it in a few months, before the holidays.
Just ignore them, Ron! Ron does not acknowledge him.
Malfoy provoked us.
Ban us...for life.
You've--!
You can't!
If you quit, we'll be out four players! Ron looks miserable.
Hagrid, what happened to you?
We know you were looking for giants, Hagrid. Dumbledore said so last year.
So what did you do when you found them?
What happened then?
Glad to see all of you could find this place all right.
Loads of Defense Against the Dark Arts equipment. Hopefully we'll be able to get to all of it before the end of term. He paces in front of them.
You need to understand something before we start, though. Defending yourself from the Dark Arts has less to do with magical ability and more to do with thinking fast and a lot of luck.
We'll be doing Expelliarmus tonight, though hopefully we can move on to other things if we have time.
Besides, it works. I used it against You-Know-Who last June. It saved my life. Zacharias falls silent.
Right. Well, let's split into pairs and give it a go.
Well done, Neville! He shouts down the others.
Look here, you lot! Neville's really got the hang of this one.
Go ahead again. Fred tosses Ron's wand to him. Neville swirls his wand.
Never forget this spell, Neville. It could save your live some day. He moves to the front of the room again.
Okay, everyone. We've done a lot today, and I've seen some great improvement. That's it for now. We'll meet back here, same time next week!
Mr. Weasley's been attacked!
No, I saw it happen! I...I was there... Ron is looking pale.
Yes! We've got to do something or he will die!
It wasn't a nightmare! Well, I was asleep, but it wasn't a normal dream. It was...well, real. I saw, well--Mr. Weasley has been attacked by a giant snake. Ron is looking very pale.
Oh. Uh...I was the snake. I saw it from the snake's perspective.
Yes!
Sirius, I-- He stops. Sirius looks at him.
When I saw the attack, well, I was the snake.
I felt the fangs like they were mine, saw through the snake's eyes like they were mine... Sirius looks concerned.
I think I might be going mad. There is a horrible silence. Sirius looks uncomfortable.
But what if there's a snake inside me?
There's no need--
Uh, sure... Just then, a HEALER emerges from a DOUBLE-DOOR nearby.
I have to.
I won't hurt anybody else.
What is it?
That's it? Stay there while the grown-ups sort things out?
Fine! Go! And tell Dumbledore thanks for nothing!

Get out!
Ginny, I'm dangerous. You can't be around me.
I forgot.
No, I don't think so.

Thanks, Ginny.
Haven't seen him.
What's that? Snape sneers.
There is an awkward silence.
Hey Cho! She turns to him.
Well, uh, Valentine's Day is the same day as our next Hogsmead visit. She blushes harder.
Well, uh, would you like to, you know, go with me?
She smiles at him and walks away.
What's that, Professor?
Voldemort can read minds?
So he could read our minds right now?
But hasn't it helped so far? I mean, it saved Mr. Weasley's life, didn't it?
What are you going to do?
NO!
I've been there before...
I've just realized... Snape is staring at him, agitated.
What's in the Department of Mysteries, sir?
That corridor, I've been dreaming about it for months...it leads to the Department of Mysteries, I'm sure of it.
It's got to be.
Probably. Mr. Weasley was probably there when he was attacked, too. That must be what the Order's guarding!
They're all Death Eaters!
Voldemort.
Ok. He goes to Cho, and they leave together.
What?
Oh. Uh, no, there wasn't really much time... Cho bursts into tears. Harry tries to console her.
Look, maybe we should talk about something else...
What's this all about?
Yeah, I guess so. Hermione sits back and sips her drink.
What on earth? Hermione beams at him.
I have just published an article telling the real story about what happened last June. Umbridge instantly turns an ugly shade of purple in her rage.
What?
We've been doing so well, I thought we'd work on some defensive blocking spells tonight.
That was really good. With a CRACK, Dobby appears.
What is it, Dobby?
Who, Dobby? Dobby shakes his head.
Is it Umbridge? Dobby nods. Harry looks up, horrified. Dobby forces his arms down and takes a breath.
Get out of here! Now!
Not really, no.
School rules? No.
Not that I know of.
Professor, no!
I'm so sorry, Professor!
Are you sure you can't? Hagrid said it was important.
Could you tell us what it is, Hagrid, please?
Oh, yeah. Well, I did think about being an Auror.
What's involved in them?
Thanks, Professor.

No!
I--sorry!
No, of course not!
They're heading for Hagrid's! Ron and Harry exchange nervous glances.
No!
No--no, I've done all I can.
Voldemort! He's got Sirius! In the Department of Mysteries! Ron looks pale.
I just saw it.
How're we going to get there?
We've got to do something! Ron and Hermione exchange looks.
I won't let Sirius die! Just then Ginny, Luna, Fred, and George round the corner.
Voldemort's broken into the Department of Mysteries. He's got Sirius there!
He could already have the weapon!
There isn't anyone else, Hermione! Everyone from the Order is gone!
No, there isn't!
How?
That's all we'll need. Fred and George straighten.
Grimmauld Place!
Sirius! Are you here!
Sirius! Lupin? Hello?
Kreacher, where's Sirius?
You know where he is, don't you?
But you know. Kreacher grins horribly.
It's none of your business.
He's got Padfoot at the place it's hidden!
You sent the Dementors?
Hermione, no!
I would rather die!
Great plan, Hermione.
What are we supposed to do now?
We've got no brooms.
What are those?
All right, then. Get on one, and we'll be off.
All right, come on.
Where is everyone?
That's how Voldemort got in unnoticed. They walk until they reach the hallway from Harry's dreams.
This is it. Come on.
Stay close. He steps into the next room.
I don't understand. In my dream, the doors weren't identical.
Yeah. I'll know the way when I see it. He goes to the first door he sees and opens the door. He steps inside. The others follow.
Who's there?
Sirius?
Does anyone else hear that?
Sirius...yeah...

Whatever's in there, the Ministry sure doesn't want anyone getting to it. He moves to the next door and opens it, stepping inside.
This is it! Come on! They move through the clocks.
This is it. This is where Sirius is! He opens the door and charges through.
He's in here somewhere.
What's my name doing here?

It's got my name on it! He takes it off the shelf and looks at it.
Where's Sirius? Lucius, and several other death eaters laugh.
You never did, did you? It was all just a trick.
What prophesy? Lucius points at the Golden orb.
Go ahead. Lucius regards him coldly.
Come and find out! Lucius doesn't move.
You even try to take her and I'll smash this thing.
So, what kind of prophesy are we talking about here?
Not really. How come Voldemort wants it?
Who, Voldemort? Oh, yeah, I dare. Voldemort, voldemort, Voldemort--
Hey, did you know Voldemort's a half-blood too? Bella raises her wand to strike, but Malfoy stops her again.
What's so special about this prophesy anyway? Bella shrieks with laughter.
What? Lucius and the Death Eaters laugh.
When I give the signal, blast the shelves... Hermione and Ron nod grimly.
But why did he need me to take it?
So he used me to do his dirty work, did he?
NOW!
RUN!
Where'd the rest go? Hermione looks around.
Stupify!
Stupify!
Ron! Two Death Eaters enter the room.
Pretificus Totalus!
Hermione! He runs to her. She appears to be sleeping.
Please don't be dead, please don't be dead... He shakes her.
Hermione, wake up... Neville runs over.
Can we carry her?
I don't know...
What happened.
We need to get out of here. Luna, can you help Ginny? Luna moves to her side. Another door opens, and five death eaters emerge.
Let my friends go and I will.
Stop, Neville!
Are you all right?
You come with us! Sirius shakes his head.
Protego! Malfoy's spell bounces away from Harry.

Sirius!

Let me go! He hits at Lupin, trying to break away from him.
LIAR!
No...no...no....
Stupify!
Crucio!
Can't. It got smashed by accident!
How's Voldemort going to like that? You've failed him, and he's not very forgiving, is he? Bellatrix lets out a shriek of horror.
He can't hear you from here, you know!
Look out!
Professor! He stands up.
Kill me now, Dumbledore...do it, if death means nothing...
No you don't!
You don't have a clue! You can't possibly know!
Then I don't want to be human!
I don't care! I don't care!
Let me out.
You can't keep me in here!
I already know all this.
Well, yeah, I did...
But Snape stopped giving me lessons.
He barely taught me, though. I always felt more open to it after the lessons. Like he was trying to open me to Voldemort--
Sirius didn't trust him. Didn't believe he'd really turned to our side...
I've been dreaming about that all year, before Voldemort discovered the connection.
But I checked Grimmauld Place! Kreacher said--
Why?
What?
Wait, where was Sirius when I tried to contact him?
And Hermione said we should be nice to Kreacher!
Sirius hated him.
Yeah, he really hated that place. And you kept him locked up in there!
She never loved me.
I asked you why Voldemort tried to kill me.
I don't understand, Professor. Dumbledore sighs again.
Professor, why am I so important to him? Harry hangs his head.
Sir, it got smashed.
I'm not sure I understand all that, sir...
And...it means me?
So it's not necessarily me, sir?
What if he chose wrong?
Why didn't he wait? Why attack when we were babies?
But I don't have any special powers. Dumbledore is silent for a moment.
What is it, sir?
One of us has to kill the other...in the end. Dumbledore nods, and there are tears misting his eyes.
Hey, Nick.
Oh. Thanks. He stands and they begin to walk back to the castle together.
Nick, I was wondering about something? Nick looks even more uncomfortable now.
Expecting what?
I expect so... There is a silence.
Why?
How are you?

You two go on. I want to be alone for a while.
I've got something to tell you. Something important. They stop and look at him again.
But not right now. I'm not ready.
Then why are you putting up signs?
Do you need any help looking?
Yeah.
Have you ever...you know...
I'm sorry.
Isn't it?
You mean we'll see them again?
Lumos Maxima...
Lumos Maxima...
Lumos Maxima...
Lumos... MAXIMA!
Uncle Vernon. I need you to sign this form.
Nothing. Something for school...
I will if she does.
Yes.

Oh, yes. I've been beaten loads of times.
That's a lie.

My dad wasn't a drunk.
Shut up! Shut up!
No! She deserved what she got! And you... you keep away from me.
Anywhere's better than here.
Aaaah!
Fell over.
I didn't do it on purpose.
I didn't.
The Leaky Cauldron. That's in London -
Isn't this a bit... dangerous?
Who is that? That man.
How'd he escape?
Yeah. Him I've heard of.
This bus. Don't the Muggles ever...

No thank you. Minister... I don't understand. I broke the law. Underage wizards aren't allowed to use magic at home -
'The state of things' sir?
Sirius Black, you mean. But... what's that got to do with me?
Egypt! What's it like?
Good to see you too, Mrs. Weasley.
Of course, Mr. Weasley.
Has this anything to do with him, sir?
That he escaped from Azkaban. That he killed someone...
Voldemort...?
Voldemort...?
I know, sorry. Ron hates it too.
Kill me?
Mr. Weasley, why would I go looking for someone who wants to kill me?
I didn't mean to blow her up. I just... (troubled by the memory) ... lost control.
Hi, Neville.

Is he really asleep?
Close the door.

Dunno... Maybe we've broken down?
Thanks.
What was that -- that thing?
What happened to me?
And did either of you? You know... pass out?
But someone was screaming. A woman.
Fortuna Major.
Yeah...
Listen, you stupid prat -

Excuse me?
Brilliant... Professor.
At least Hagrid didn't get sacked.
Yes, Professor, but I thought if you said I could go -


Not to mention The Shrieking Shack, which, according to Hermione, is the most severely haunted building in Britain.
Professor, can I ask you something?
I did think of Voldemort first. But then, I remembered that night on the train... and the Dementors...
Before I fainted... I heard something. A woman. Screaming.
I think it was my mother. The night she was murdered.
Sirius Black's trying to kill me.
I'm glad you had a good time. Really. And thanks for this.
Rubbish or not, you're right. It can't hurt.
Excuse me, sir, but... where's Professor Lupin?
Come on! Faster!
Probably a right sight better than he normally does.
Brilliant.
What happened?
Really? I meant the match. Who won?
Why do they affect me so, Professor? I mean, more than everyone else...
I'm scared, Professor.
I need to learn how to fight them. You could teach me, Professor. You made that Dementor on the train go away...
But you made it go away.
What's this rubbish?
'Messrs Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs are proud to present The Marauder's Map'...?
Hang on. This is Hogwarts! And that... No. Is that really... Harry points to a small MOVING DOT labeled "Dumbledore."
You mean, this map shows...
Everyone?
Brilliant! Where'd you get it?
The One-Eyed...
Dissendium?
Mischief managed.
Shhh.
He was their friend. And he betrayed them. He was their friend.
I hope he finds me. But when he does, I'm going to be ready. When he does, I'm going to kill him.
If Black can fight the Dementors, I need to know how too.
Expecto Patronum...
Expecto... Patronum...
Expecto... Expecto...
That's one nasty Dementor.
The first time I rode a broom.
There's another. It's not happy exactly. I mean, it is. It's the happiest I've ever felt. But it's... complicated.
Just do it!
Expecto Patronum!
I think I've had enough. today. For Lupin nods. Watches Harry move to the door.
I was thinking of him. And Mum. Seeing their faces. They're just talking to me. Just... talking. That was the memory I chose. I don't even know if it's real...
But it's the best I have.
Everybody out!
Show yourself.
Ron! Ron!
I could've killed him.
He was right there. Close enough to touch. I could've killed him.
No, I won't. Know why? Because I don't care about your stupid rat! I don't care about your stupid cat! I've got few other things on my mind right now!
I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.
Mischief managed!
I was... I was... sleepwalking...
My dad didn’t strut. Nor do I. Now, if you don't mind, I'd appreciate you lowering your wand.
Spare bit of parchment...
'Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs offer their compliments to Professor Snape and...'
'... and request that he keep his abnormally large nose out of other people's business.'
Professor. Just so you know, I don't think the map always works. Earlier, it showed someone in the castle. Someone I know to be dead.
Peter Pettigrew.
Professor Trelawney -
S-sorry?
No. Nothing.
It just got worse.
I say we set him free.
Ow!
Hagrid...
C'mon.
What?
That's not good.
Ron! Run!
Hold on, Ron!
No, Ron...
Nooooo!!!
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
Don't mention it. Lumos.
I have a hunch. I just hope I'm wrong...
Nox.
The dog -- where's the -
Then it'll be you!
Yes.

Professor Lupin!

No!
You betrayed my parents! You sold them to Voldemort!
Did he listen! When my mother was dying! Did he hear her screaming!
What're you talking about? There's nobody here.
Expelliarmus!
You said Peter before. Peter who?
No. Pettigrew's dead. He killed him.
The Map was lying then -
All they could find of Pettigrew was his -
Show me.
No.
I know what he is. But we'll take him to the castle.
Get off! I said we'd take you to the castle. After that, the Dementors can have you.
I don't reckon my father'd want his best friends to become killers for a worthless piece of vermin like Pettigrew. Besides: Dead, the truth dies with him. Alive... you're free.
I know.
Come live with you? When!
No!
Expelliarmus!
Sirius!
NO!!!
Please, Professor. Stop... It's me.
Sirius!
Sirius!
No... No!
Expecto... Patronum!
Expecto... Patronum...
I saw my dad.
He sent the Dementors away... I saw him. Across the lake...
The Kiss...?
You mean, they're going to kill Sirius?
It's true, sir. Sirius is innocent -
What just happened? Where's Ron?
Huh? Dunno... going to Hagrid's?
Hermione! Will you please tell me what it is we're doing?!
But that... that's... us. This is not... normal.
You mean, we've gone back in time?

Good punch. Hurry!
Buckbeak's still alive.
Buckbeak? But... how will saving Buckbeak help Sirius?
Nothing.
Here they come. I better hurry.
That's Pettigrew -
Hermione, that's the man who betrayed my parents! You don't expect me to just sit here...
Are you mad?
That hurt.
Shhh!
Get away!
C'mon, Buckbeak. Come on...
Now what?
And we do that... how?
And now we wait.
Hermione...
Before. Down by the lake. When I was with Sirius... I did see someone... that someone made the Dementors go away...
It was my Dad.
It was my Dad who conjured the Patronus.
Dead. I know. I'm just telling you what I saw.
You see Sirius talking to me? He's asking me to come live with him.
When we free him, I'll never have to go back to the Dursley's. I'm going to tell him I'd like to live someplace in the country. I think he'd like that, after all those years in Azkaban. We don't need a big place and I can help him...
Which means Pettigrew is slipping safely into the night. While we just stand here...
OWWWWWWWWW!
What are you doing?
Thanks. But we have to move.
Because that werewolf you just called is running right this way.
Let's go.
Don't worry. My Dad will come... Right there... you'll see... he'll come... any minute... he'll conjure the Patronus
He will come!
EXPECTO PATRONUM!
You were right, Hermione. It wasn't my dad I saw earlier. It was... me. I saw myself conjuring the Patronus before. I knew I could do it this time, because... because I'd already done it. Does that make sense?
I want to go with you.
Anything.
He's free -- Sirius. We... we did it.
Afraid so. Always been a bit of the nervous type, Ron has.
You've been sacked.
Resigned! But why!
Snape.
But Dumbledore -
Well. At first I thought it was a horse, or perhaps a unicorn, but I think it was -
Yes.
Whose is that?
But... how? Who?
That's a Hippogriff feather -
I don't think it works. I think it's defective.

Oh, come on now. It's just a broom.
The fastest broom in the world.
Yes, Aunt Petunia.
Yes, Uncle Vernon.
Thirty-eight, popkin.
Yes, Aunt Petunia.
You could just leave me here.
He's asleep.
Sorry about him. He doesn't understand what it's like, lying there day after day, watching people press their ugly faces in on you...
Can you hear me?
It's just, I've never talked to a snake before. Do you, I mean... do you talk to people often?
So ... you're from Burma, aren't you? Was it nice there? Do you miss your family?
I see. That's me as well. I never knew my parents either...
I swear, I don't know how it happened! One minute the glass was there and then it was gone. It was like magic.

Will I have to wear that too?
But that's Dudley's old uniform. It'll fit me like bits of old elephant skin.
That's mine!
I want my letter!
NO! I WANT MY LETTER!

Because there's no post on Sundays.
Make a wish, Harry.
I am.
Thank you .
Excuse me, but ... who are you?
Learned what?
I'm a what?
No. You've made a mistake. I ... I can't be a ... wizard. I mean ... I'm just ... Harry. Just Harry.
'Dear Mr. Potter, We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry ... '
You knew? You knew I'm a ... a wizard?
Blown up? You told me my parents died in a car crash.
Muggle?
'First year students will require three sets of plain work robes, one plain pointed hat for day wear, one pair of dragon-hide gloves...'
' ... and the following Set Books: The Standard Book of Spells by Miranda Goshawk. One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi by Phyllida Spore ... '
'One wand, one standard Size 2 pewter cauldron and may bring, if they desire, either an owl, a cat, or a toad.'
Can we find all this in London?
Why am I famous, Hagrid? All those people back there. How is it they know who I am?
Dragon Liver? Do they mean from a real dragon'?
You'd like a dragon'?

But how am I to pay for all this, Hagrid? I haven't any money.
Hagrid, what exactly was that?
What's in here, Hagrid?
How often do you check to see if anyone's inside?
I still need ... a wand.
Sorry, but what's curious?
And who owned that wand?


For me? Really? He's Mine?
I haven't. Not really.

He killed my parents, didn't he? The one who gave me this. You know, Hagrid. I know you do.

Maybe if you wrote it down.
Voldemort?
Me? Voldemort tried to kill me?
But what happened to Vol... to You-Know-Who?
There must be something wrong, Hagrid. This says Platform Nine and Three Quarters. There's no such thing.
...Is there?
Excuse me. Can you tell me where I might find Platform Nine and Three-Quarters.
Excuse me. Could you tell me--
Yes, please.
Thanks very much.
What'? Oh, him. Yes. I mean, I am.
Not at all.
I heard. I'm Harry.
Are all your family wizards?
Horrible. Well, not all of them. Mine are, though. Trade them for three wizard brothers any day.
We'll take the lot.
'Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans'?
These aren't real 'frogs, are they?
I've gotten Dumbledore!

Considered by many the greatest wizard of modern times, Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for his discovery of the 12 uses of dragon's blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel. Approximately one hundred and fifty years old, Professor Dumbledore enjoys chamber music, tenpin bowling, and...'
One hundred arid fifty years old?
No-- I--Hey, he's gone.
It's just, in the Muggle world, people stay put in photos.
Am I?
How exactly do they sort us?
I think I can tell the wrong sort for myself, thanks.
Ouch!
N-nothing. I'm fine.
Say, Percy. Who's that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?
What's he teach?
How many staircases are there?
We got lost.
I don't know, sir.
I don't know, sir.
Clearly Hermione knows. It seems a pity not to ask her.
What's Seamus trying to do to that glass of water?
Hey, Ron. Somebody broke into Gringotts! Listen: 'Believed to be the work of Dark wizards or witches unknown, Gringotts goblins, while acknowleging the breach, insist nothing was taken. The vault in question had, in fact, been emptied earlier that very same day.' That's odd.
No. It's just odd... That's the day Hagrid and I were there.
Give it here, Malfoy.
Give it here. Or I'll knock you off that ruddy broom.
--a century. According to McGonagall. Just then, Fred and George descend.
I've never even played Quidditch. What if I make a fool of myself?
I... didn't know.
Who doesn't?

Why, though?
And for good reason...

Guarding something.
I think so. What's in there?
What was that?
I like this ball.
What do I do with it?
Wingardium Leviosa.
I think we're going to need another feather over here, Professor.
I think she heard you.
Yes, Professor. Fine.
I'm all right, Professor.
Professor... Thank you.
How could a troll get in?
Hermione. She doesn't know.
That's the third floor he's going to. Teachers were supposed to go to the dungeons...
What's that?
Follow me.
This wouldn't be the girl's bathroom, would it?

Confuse it!
I don't think so. Just knocked out.
Yes, well, that was big of you. Ugh. Troll snot.
Good of her to get us out of trouble like that.
Mind you, she might not have needed saving if we hadn't locked the thing in with her.
I'm not hungry.
That explains the blood.
Last night, Ron and I saw Snape heading for the third floor. I'm guessing he let the troll in as a diversion, tried to get past the three-headed dog, and got himself bit. That's why he's limping._
Listen. The day I was at Gringotts, Hagrid took something out of one of the vaults. Said it was Hogwarts business. Very secret.
That's what the dog's guarding. That's what Snape wants.
One place, according to Hagrid. Hogwarts.
Or really dangerous.
That's Hedwig.
It's a broomstick.
But who...?
Pretty close.
What happened?
Who's he, Angelina?
The Snitch!
What's George doing?
I knew I should have gone out for football.
Who knows? Why was he trying to get past that three-headed dog on Halloween?
Yes?
But Hagrid, whatever Fluffy's guarding, Snape's trying to steal it.
Nicolas Flamel. Why does that name sound familiar?
I've got presents.
Your father left this in my possession before he died. It is time it was returned to you.
It's some kind of... cloak.
...There's no name ... It just says, 'Use it well.'
Flamel. Nicolas Flamel...
Ah!
Mum? Dad?
Ron! Ron! Wake up!
There's something you've got to see!
Come look! It's my family.
Look in properly, go on, stand here.
There. You see them, don't you? That's-

How can it? All my family are dead.
No.
No.
It shows me my family.
So, then, it shows us what we want... Whatever we want...
Can I ask you something, Professor? What do you see when you look in the Mirror?
I've found him.
I knew the name sounded familiar. I read it on the train that day.
The what?
So Flamel knows someone's after the Stone... gives it to Dumbledore to keep safe at Hogwarts ... not realizing that the one who's after it .. .
What is it, Hermione?
We know about the Sorcerer's Stone.
Hagrid, we know he's after the Stone. We just don't know... why.
What?
Wait a minute. One of the teachers?
Hagrid... exactly what is that?
Norbert?
Malfoy!
Hagrid always wanted a dragon. Told me so the first time I ever met him.
I don't Understand. Is that bad?
Fifty?
It's all right Hagrid. Besides, it's not your fault we were out after hours. If we hadn't come knocking on your door in the middle of the night--
What's that?
If I didn't know better, Draco, I'd say you were scared.
I'm not, believe me...
What was that thing you saved me from?
But who would choose such a life?
Do you mean to say that thing that killed the unicorn, that was drinking its blood, that was Voldemort!
The Sorcerer's Stone.
The Philosopher's Stone.
But he's weak. He's living off the unicorns. Don't you see? We had it wrong. Snape doesn't want the Stone for himself. He wants the Stone for Voldemort. With the Elixer of Life Voldemort will be strong again. He'll... come back.
I think if he'd had the chance, he might have tried to kill me tonight.
My scar. Keeps... burning.
Not like this...
No...
Don't you think it's a bit odd, that what Hagrid wants more than anything is a dragon? And a stranger turns up who just happens to have one? I mean, how many people wander around with dragon eggs in their pocket? Why didn't I see it before?
Didn't that strike you as unusual?
This stranger, though. talked... You and he must've...
And did he seem interested in Fluffy?
We have to see Professor Dumbledore. Immediately.
He's gone? Now? But this is important! This is about... the Sorcerer's Stone.
Someone's going to try and steal it.
That was no stranger Hagrid met in the village. It was Snape. Which means be knows how to get past Fluffy.
Go through the trapdoor. Tonight.
Now, Neville, listen...
Snoring.
Suppose we won't be needing this now. Look, its obvious Snape's already got past Fluffy. If you two want to go back--
Right then. All together now.
I'll go first. Don't follow until I give you a sign. If something... bad happens... get yourselves out--
Does it seem a bit... quiet...to you?
We must be miles under the school.
Wo!
Uh, Hermione, it's a bit difficult to relax...
...given the circumstances.
Hermione!

Hermione? But how... where?
I suggest we do what she says.
Apparently not.
Lucky Hermione pays attention in Herbology.
I don't know... sounds like wings.
They're not birds...
They're keys. And I'll bet one of them fits that door.

It's... too simple.
Where are we? A graveyard?
Just tell us what to do.
Wait a minute...
She's made the same mistake I always make. If I go there, she has to take me, and the Ring is exposed!
No, Ron...
He's going to sacrifice himself.
No!
Don't forget we're still playing.

Checkmate.
If you can, go to the owlery and send a message to Dumbledore. Ron's right. I have to go on.

Not as good as you.
You!
No. It can't be. Snape...
But that day, during the Quidditch match... Snape to kill me.
Snape was trying to save me?
You let the Troll in.
I... I'm shaking hands with Dumbledore. I... I've won the House cup.

Voldemort.
Never!
Liar!
Admirers?
Ron was here? Is he all right? What about Hermione--
But what happened to the--
But then, Flamel... he'll die, won't he?
But to destroy such a remarkable thing...
How is it I got the Stone, Sir? One minute I was staring in the mirror--
Does that mean--with the Stone gone, that is--that Voldemort can never come back?

Professor Dumbledore. Voldemort said... if I gave him the Stone, he could bring back my...family. Could he have, sir? Really?
What is it?
All right there, Ron?
All right. Hermione?
I think Dumbledore knows pretty much everything that goes on here. The only thing I don't understand is Snape...
Yes, of course. I was only wondering. Is it true? Did he hate my father?
What was that?
But Hagrid. We' re not allowed to do magic away from Hogwarts. You know that.
I'm not going home... Not really.
