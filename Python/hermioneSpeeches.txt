A Stinging Jinx.
Not long.
I don’t know what you’re talking about.
I told you. I don’t know what you’re talking -Hermione SCREAMS in pain. wall, turns. Ron slams his fist against the
Harry, are you thinking there’s a Horcrux in Bellatrix’s vault?
Positive.
Can’t I use the other?
But I hate that thing -- that’s the wand that killed Sirius! How can I hold it and not feel...
It is, Harry. Did Dumbledore ever say anything to you, something that might explain why -
It’s perfect. Thank you, Fleur.
Well, how do I look?
Oh dear, I missed a spot, didn’tI? Hold still...
Good morning. The Warlock eyes her oddly, then continues on. As Hermione retreats back into the alley, Griphook emerges from the shadows, his voice harsh and mocking.
He’s right. I was being stupid.
I hardly think that will be
I wish to enter my vault.
I don’t like to be kept waiting.
He’s with me.
As difficult as that may be to imagine.
And why should I do that?
No, I most certainly do not understand --
It looks like it’s been down here forever.
That’s barbaric. I...
Look.
No wonder Bellatrix thought it was real.
It’s hot!
Ron, your foot!
How’re we going to reach it?
Harry! Behind you!
In here!
We can’t just stand here! Who’s got an idea?
I’ve got something. But it’s mad.
Relashio!
It doesn’t realize it’s free! (trying out spells) Leviosa! Aviates! Ex Cappa!
When?
How is it you -
You let him in! Harry, you can’t -
What?
You saw it?
Tonight? But we have to plan. We have to figure out what -
They were ready for us.
No, you’ll give us away.
I know. Hearing this, Harry slips the mirror from his pocket. FOOTSTEPS sound from below.
Harry! I can see you! In here!
Do you hear much from the others? From the Order?
That’s Ariana, isn’t it? Your sister. She’s beautiful.
* She died very young, didn’t she.
Mr. Dumbledore... thank you.
Did save our lives twice. Kept an eye on us in that mirror. That doesn’t seem like someone who’s given up, does it?
She’s coming back! And she’s got someone with her!
Neville... The GILDED FRAME SWINGS OPEN, revealing -- in actuality -- what the painting had replicated. Harry pelts forward...
How bad is it, Neville? With Snape as Headmaster.
They did that to you? But why?
Unless we can destroy it.
You were thinking. It’s Ron’s idea. And it’s brilliant.
Where are you going?
No. Of course not.
Ron looks at her, then hoists himself through. Me too.
I didn’t expect it to be like this.

There he is.
He vanished. Just now. I saw it.
That’s right. I did.
Brilliant.
Did you see where it went? The diadem!
Do we climb!
C’mon! This way!
Someplace safe.
NO!
Where is everyone?
Where’ve you been?
What is it, Harry? What is it you know?
I’ll go with you. I’ll -
Yes!
I don’t want you to say anything you wouldn’t say if we weren’t about to be killed by a giant snake! It’ll just ruin it!
What’s the matter with her?
Can’t make an omelette without breaking a few eggs.
Something my mum used to say.
Why didn’t it work for him? The Elder wand.
We?
Don’t forget to give Professor Longbottom our best.
Coming, Mum.
Obliviate.
Goodbye.

I told you he’d take it well.

Harry, your eyesight really is awful.
Really?
We were friendly, not close like Harry, but --
To Harry! It belongs to Harry! It chose him! It came to him in the Chamber of Secrets when he most needed it!
Where is your guard, sir?
Ron! Ron!
Shaftesbury Avenue. I used to come here to the theater with my mum and dad. Just popped into my head. I don’t know why...
This way!
We need to change.
Undetectable Extension Charm.
Always the tone of surprise.
That’ll be the books.
Ron’s right. Cappuccino, please.
Too dangerous. If Voldemort’s taken over the Ministry, none of the old places are safe.
I’ve had the essentials packed for days. Just in case.
Petrificus Totalus!
Go.
Obliviate.
Maybe you still have the Trace on you.
We didn’t celebrate your birthday, Harry. Ginny and I -- we’d prepared a cake. We were going to bring it out at the end of the wedding...
Right. Perspective.
Mad-eye’s doing, I’d guess. In case Snape decided to come snooping.
Homenum revelio.
It’s a spell to reveal human presence.
We’re alone.

Harry! Harry!
Ron! I’ve found him! Good! git!
Harry, you can’t just disappear. We thought -
It’s from your Mum. To Sirius. Bathilda Bagshot...?

Did she now?
Harry. I can imagine why you’d want to go there, but... I don’t think Bathilda Bagshot is going to know where Voldemort hid his Horcruxes.
Lovely.
Regulus Arcturus Black...?
Yes. Question is, did he actually destroy the real Horcrux?
Maybe he knows.
But was it here? Did you ever see it?
Ron! RON!
They have flesh memories.

Snitches. They’re never touched by bare skin until the Seeker captures it. Even the wizard who fabricates it wears gloves. That way, if there’s a dispute, the Snitch can identify who first touched it.

When Scrimgeour first gave it to you, I thought it might open at your touch -- that Dumbledore had hidden something in it.
Expelliarmus!
Stop lying!
You’ve still got it.
Well, unless one of you fancies wearing a skirt...
Remember what we said. Keep your eyes down. Don’t speak to anyone unless absolutely necessary. Act as normal as possible. Just do what you see everyone else doing. We do that -- and with a bit of luck -- we get ourselves inside. And then... Ron
Correct.
Completely, utterly, without question.
Mafalda Hopkirk, assistant in the Improper Use of Magic Office.
You’re somebody. Be careful.

Muggles. In their rightful place.
You appear to be quite popular.
I didn’t.
Try Finite Incantatem. Of course if something’s gone wrong with an Atmospheric Charm --
This is you.
I don’t like him being on his own down there.
You really have horrible teeth, you know that.
Relashio!
Harry... they’ve seen you. We’ve got to get out of here.
Harry, quickly, in my bag, there’s a small bottle labeled ‘Essence of Dittany.’
Quickly!
Unstopper it.
Just do it!
We were. We were there. But Yaxley had hold of me. I knew we couldn’t stay once he’d seen, so when he let go I brought us here. Ron got Splinched. I’m... sorry.
It’s all I feel safe doing.
Salvio Hexia... Protego Totalum...
Protective enchantments. I don’t fancy another visit like we had onShaftesbury Avenue, do you? Especially with Ron like this. You can get going on the tent...
Repello Muggletum... Muffliato...
How’re the mushrooms? Seem to be the only edible things growing round here.
Make sure to leave some for Ron.
He’ll be alright in a few days. Hopefully. If we could take him to Hogwarts, to Madam Pomfrey -
So where do we go next?
It scares me a bit, that, thinking it’s a piece of Vol-

Dinner?
Tea?
I hate it. It’s like he’s here with us.
Incendio!
Confringo!
What’re you doing?
I can put it in my bag -
I thought it had stopped.
You can’t let him in, Harry. Dumbledore himself said it. You have to close your mind. It’s too dangerous -
Tell me. What you saw.
The wandmaker?
Viktor got his wand from Gregorovitch. Most Durmstrang students did at one time. What’s he got to do with You-Know-Who?
Don’t -- It... comforts him.
I think he just hopes he doesn’t hear bad news. It gets him through the day.
We’ve all made sacrifices, Harry.
I don’t know. It takes time. I’m doing all I can.
Take it off.
Take it off. Now.
Better?
It’s cold. Even though it’s been lying against your skin for days.
We’ll take turns. Okay?
He could smell it. My perfume.
I told you. Ron’s not strong

No one can conjure food out ofthin air. Food is the first of the five Principal Exceptions toGamp’s Law. The other four are -
Good plan.
None of us do.
I don’t like this place. Harry and Ron both turn, look at her.
I want to go.
Oh my god...
I’ll tell you in a minute.
Alright. The Sword of Gryffindor? It’s Goblin made.
You don’t understand. Dirt and rust have no effect on the blade.
Harry. You already destroyed one Horcrux, right? Tom Riddle’s diary -- in the Chamber of Secrets.
Don’t you see! In the Chamber of Secrets, you stabbed the basilisk with the Sword of Gryffindor. Its blade is impregnated with basilisk venom.
Exactly! Which means...
Which is why Dumbledore left it to you in his will.
Actually, I’m highly logical, which allows me to look past the extraneous detail and perceive clearly that which others overlook.

Ron...
Take it off, Ron. Please take it off. You wouldn’t be talking like this if you hadn’t been wearing it all day -
Harry, we weren’t -
I didn’t! Not like that! Harry -- I didn’t!
Stop! Stop!
Me?
What? Ron, no -- please -
He’s gone.
It’s a Muggle station.
‘I open at the close?’
I don’t know. But look, I’ve found something as well...
I thought it was a picture of an eye, but now I don’t think it is. It isn’t a rune and it’s not in Spellman’s Syllabary either. And it’s been inked in -- somebody drew it -- it isn’t part of the book.
What d’you mean -- wearing it?
Why would someone have drawn it in a children’s book?
And it’s exactly where You-Know- Who will expect you to go. Because it means something to you.
It’s dangerous, Harry. But I have to admit, recently even I’ve been thinking we might have to go. I think it’s possible something else is hidden there.
The sword. If Dumbledore didn’t want it falling into theMinistry’s hands, but wanted you to find it, what better place to hide it than the birthplace of the founder of Gryffindor himself?

Harry, did you ever even open A History of Magic?
Don’t ever let me give you a haircut again.
I still think we should’ve used Polyjuice Potion.
Harry, I think it’s Christmas Eve! Listen...
Yeah. I think they would.
Harry.
No. But look.
Did you know he had a sister?
Lumos.
Ignotus... Hey, Har -

Happy Christmas, Harry.
Harry...
Someone’s watching us. By the gate.
I don’t think this is a good idea.
Muggles who’ve just been laying flowers on your parents’ grave.
Omigod. Harry...
Harry, I’m not sure about this.
There’s something odd about her. And what’s that smell?
You have a lovely house, Miss Bagshot. Hermione eyes a PHOTOGRAPH of a CURIOUSLY COMPELLING YOUNG GIRL
, then runs a finger along a table. It comes away thick with dust. She frowns, looks up, finds Bathilda watching her.
All right...
Why?
Harry...

Harry!
Confringo!

Harry... Harry, can you hear me...?

Good. That’s good...

Yes.

I’m fine. But you’ve been sick. Rest... Rest a bit more...
The Forest of Dean. I came here once with my mum and dad, years ago. It’s just how I remember it. The trees. The river. It’s like nothing’s changed. Not true, of course. Everything’s changed. If I brought my parents here, they wouldn’t recognize any of it. Not the trees. Not the river. Not... me.
Wendell and Monica Wilkens now reside happily in Sydney, Australia. They have two dogs, run a small sweet shop, but floss daily. No children. She smiles, then it fades.
Maybe we should just stay here, Harry. Grow old. Harry has no words. She inhales, shakes off her tears.
You wanted to know who the boy in the photograph was. Well, I know.
It was in Bathilda’s sitting room. Rita Skeeter had sent it to her. Harry, it doesn’t make for very nice reading -
Yes.
For a time.
Gellert Grindelwald. He’s not very well known in Britain, but there was a time, before You-Know-Who...
When Grindelwald was seventeen, he was expelled from Durmstrang. He’d started doing some twisted things at school -- experiments. A few teachers had always protected him, but they couldn’t anymore. After he left, he traveled for awhile, then ended up in Godric’s Hollow where his great aunt lived, Bathilda Bagshot.
She introduced him to Dumbledore. It made sense. Dumbledore’s mother had just died, Grindelwald was troubled and they were both brilliant -- they’d never really had anyone they could talk to ont he same level. They did a lot of talking that summer. But they always returned to one particular subject.
Wizard rule over Muggles.
Yes.
It was something Dumbledore came up with. He believed wizards were superior and should rule overMuggles, but gently, for their own good. Grindelwald took a more violent position.
It was a different time, Harry. It was one summer. Dumbledore was young -
He changed, Harry. Years later, it was Dumbledore who put Grindelwald in prison.
It’s my fault. As we were leaving Godric’s Hollow, I cast a curse and it rebounded... I’m sorry, Harry, I tried to mend it but wands are different -
Maybe we can -
He loved you, Harry. I know he loved you.
Who could look at you beside Harry Potter? What are you, compared with the Chosen One...?
Who wouldn’t prefer him, what woman would take you, you are nothing, nothing, nothing to him...
Everything all right?

You -- complete --arse -- Ronald -- Weasley! You crawl back here after all these weeks and say, ‘Hey?’ (turning to Harry) Where’s my wand? Harry, where’s my wand!
Harry Potter, you give me my wand!
Never mind why he’s got my wand -
What is that?
You destroyed it?
And exactly how is it you have theSword of Gryffindor?
Don’t think this changes anything.
See me doing what things?
What happened out there?
And what may I ask did I say?
What’s going on in there?
We need to talk.

I want to go and see Xenophilius Lovegood.
See this? It’s a letter Dumbledore wrote to Grindelwald. Look at the signature. It’s the mark again.
It keeps cropping up. Here. In Beedle the Bard. In the graveyard in Godric’s Hollow -- what?
Where?
Harry, you don’t have a clue where the next Horcrux is. And neither do I. But this, this means something. I’m sure of it.
I’m always mad at him.
Luna.
Do you see that?
No! Don’t go near it!
It’s an Erumpent horn. It’s a Class B Tradeable Material.
Where is Luna, sir?
The what?
Yes. No.
It’s in here.
Granger. Well... all right.
There were once three brothers who were traveling along a lonely, winding road at twilight -
In time, the brothers reached a river too treacherous to pass...


But being learned in the magical arts, the three brothers simply waved their wands and made a bridge. They were halfway across it when they found their path blocked by a hooded figure.

It was Death and he felt cheated, for travelers usually drowned in the river. But Death was cunning. He granted each brother a wish for their cleverness. The oldest, who was a combative man, asked for a wand more powerful than any in existence. So Death fashioned one from an elder tree on the banks of the river.

The second brother, who was an arrogant man, asked for the power to recall others from Death. So Death plucked a stone from the river. Finally Death turned to the third brother. A humble man, he asked for something that would make him disappear. And so it was that Death handed over his own Cloak of Invisibility. Death then stepped aside and the brothers went their separate ways...

The first brother traveled to a distant village where, with ElderWand in hand, he killed a wizard with whom he had once quarreled. Proceeding to an Inn, he bragged of his invincibility. But that very night...

... another wizard crept upon him as he lay sleeping. He took the Elder Wand... and slit the brother’s throat for good measure. And so Death took the first brother for his own... We see the second brother approach a cottage.

Meanwhile, the second brother journeyed to his home, where he took out the stone and turned it thrice in hand. To his delight, the girl he had once hoped to marry before her untimely death appeared before him. Yet soon she turned sad and cold, for she did not belong in the mortal world. Driven mad with hopeless longing, the second brother killed himself so as to join her. And so Death took the second brother...

As for the third brother, Death searched for many years but was never able to find him. Only when he had attained a great age did the youngest brother shed theCloak of Invisibility and give it to his son. He then greeted Death as an old friend and went with him gladly, departing this life as equals...
Mr. Lovegood, does the Peverell family have anything to do with the Deathly Hallows?
That was the name on the grave with the mark on it in Godric’s Hollow. Ignotus Peverell.
It’s obvious, isn’t it?
The Wand.
The Cloak. The Stone.
Its owner grew drunk with power and was murdered.

Why the Stone, Harry?

But according to the story they don’t want to come back. It’s all rubbish anyway. There’s no such thing as the Deathly Hallows.
There have always been Cloaks --
Mr. Lovegood. Thank you, sir --
No matter, sir. We really ought to be go-
Ron! Harry! Take my hand!
What’re you saying?
Stop it!
Penelope Clearwater. Half-blood.
A Stinging Jinx.
Not long.
Was that an owl I heard?
Really?
Harry!

A few days ago. Though... for a bit, I wasn’t sure I was coming.
She’s not alone. Even my parents-- and they’re Muggles -- know something bad is happening.
There’s been a lot of chatter lately. That he’s gotten... old.
These are adorable.
How is it Fred and George are doing it? Half the alley’s closed down.
Harry and Ron follow her gaze to the wreck that isOllivander’s Wand Shop.
But everyone got their wands fromOllivander. Young. Old... Good. Bad.
Bloody hell.
I don’t know.
Stop, Harry, I know where you’re going with this --
Harry is under the impression that Draco Malfoy is now a Death Eater.
I told you. I don’t know what I saw.
Where’s Harry?

Will. You. Stop. Eating! Your best friend is missing!

Where’ve you been, Harry? And what happened to your face?
What’s happened to his hand?
Granger, sir. That one there is Veritaserum. And that would be Polyjuice Potion. And that...
... is Amortentia! The most powerful love potion in the world. It’s rumored to smell differently to each person, according to what attracts them. For example, I smell freshly mown grass and new parchment and spearmint toothpaste -
Liquid luck.
How did you do that?
No. The instructions specifically say to cut.
Sh!
He’s vile.

No I have not. And if you had a shred of self-respect you would turn that book in.
I’d like to know just whose book that was. Let’s take a look, shall we?

Why not?
The binding is fragile?

The who?
For weeks you carry around this book, practically sleep with it... and you have no desire to find out who The Half-Blood Prince is?
Well, I was curious. So I went to
And... nothing. There’s no reference to the Half-Blood Prince anywhere.
What’ve you got there, Hagrid?
Stinksap? You’re not sick, are you?
The Aurors. I know they’re here to protect us, but... somehow I don’t feel any safer.

Three Butterbeers. Splash of ginger in mine, please.
Oh, honestly, Ronald. They’re just holding hands...
And snogging.
Leave? You can’t be serious.
So? What if she looked over here and saw you snogging me? Would you expect her to get up and leave?
Be delighted, sir.
What’s up?

I’ll get someone --
My parents are dentists. They tend to people’s teeth.
No. Though, a boy named Robbie Fenwick did bite my father once. Needed ten stitches.
Look at her eyes. They’ve been fighting again. Her and Dean.
Nothing.

How was what?
Dead boring. Though I think Harry enjoyed dessert.
Ol’ Sluggy’s having a Christmas do, you know. And we’re meant to bring someone...
Actually, I was going to ask you.
Really. But seeing as you have such a distaste for the idea -
Don’t drink that, Ron!

You could be expelled for that.
Ron seems to be enjoying himself.
You shouldn’t have done it, Harry.

That was different. It was tryouts. This was an actual match -
You didn’t put it in?
Ron only thought you did?
Charms spell. Just practicing.

How does it feel, Harry? When you see Dean with Ginny?
I know, Harry. You’re my best friend. I see how you look at her.
Oppugno!
He’s at perfect liberty to kiss whomever he likes. I really couldn’t care less. Was I under the impression that he and I would be attending Slughorn’s Christmas party together? Yes. Of course, now, given the circumstances, I’ve had to make other arrangements.
Yes. Why?

Why didn’t I think of that?

Um... it’s a surprise. Besides, it’s you we need to worry about. And you can’t pick just anyone. See that girl over there. That’s Romilda Vane. Rumor has it she’s trying to slip you a love potion.

Hey! She’s only interested in you because she thinks you’re theChosen One. You know that, right?
Hm? Oh, I’ve just escaped -- I mean, left Cormac. Under the mistletoe.
I thought it would annoy Ron most. But he’s a menace. He’s got more tentacles than a Snarfalump plant.
No thank you.

On second thought -- maybe it’ll keep Cormac at bay. Oh no, here he comes!
You’re lucky you weren’t killed.
You have to realize who you are, Harry.
So tell me what Arthur said.
What would Draco want with a Vanishing Cabinet?
He looks different, don’t you think? Draco. Almost... ill.
Excuse me, I have to go vomit.

Did you actually expect you could just walk up to Ol’ Sluggy and ask him to reveal his deepest, darkest secret? Honestly, Harry, sometimes I think the Daily Prophet should call you the Dim One.

You’re going to have to persuade him somehow. And now, I’m afraid, you’ve made it a lot harder.
That’s... not possible. No one can leave the castle these days. The Map is wrong.
I might ask you the same.
I happen to be his... friend.
He’s been poisoned, you daft dimbo! And for the record, I’ve always found him interesting.
Oh shut up.
Ron. Stop. You’re making it snow.
Um, well, she came to visit you in the hospital, you see, and you talked -- I don’t believe it was a long conversation -
Does, doesn’t she? And you say you don’t remember a thing from that night? Not one thing?
Right. Boggled...
That’s Katie. That’s Katie Bell.
Well? How do you feel?
Now remember. Slughorn usually eats early, takes a short walk and then returns to his office.
What? No, Harry -- you’ve got to go see Slughorn. We have a plan -
No.
Harry. It’s time.
If one wants it to be. Why?
Of course, and that explains the Vanishing Cabinet as well!
What if there are?
Do you think he would’ve done it. Draco?
Strange. Thinking this is a piece of Voldemort’s soul...
‘To the Dark Lord. I know I will be dead long before you read this but I want you to know that it was I who discovered your secret. I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy it as soon as I can. I face death in the hope that when you meet your match, you will be mortal once more. R.A.B.’
R.A.B.?
Ron’s okay with it, you know. and Ginny. But if I were you, when he’s around, I’d keep the snogging to a minimum.

We reckoned --Ron and me.
I’ve always admired your courage, Harry, but sometimes... you’re really thick.

You don’t honestly think you can find all those Horcruxes by yourself, do you?
You need us, Harry.

Like that’s going to happen.

Besides, he’s barking.
Yes, but I’m exceptionally perceptive.
Do you think we’ll ever... (comeback?)

Harry!
Are you alright?
Just now. You?
Wake up. Wake up Ronald!
Honestly. Get dressed, and don't go back to sleep. Come on Ron! Your mother says breakfast's ready.
What??
Harry it's his mark.
This is horrible, how can the ministry not know who conjured it. Isn't there any security or?
It's hurting again isn't it, your scar.
You know Sirius will want to hear about this. What you saw at the world cup, and the dream.
Alastor Moody? The aura.
Three sir.
Because they are unforgivable. Use of any one of them will...
Stop it! Can't you see it's bothering him, stop it!
There's a reason those curses are unforgivable, and to perform them in a classroom. I mean did you see Neville's face.
Neville?
It's not going to work.
You see this? This is an age line. Dumbledore drew it himself.
So a genius like Dumbledore couldn't possibly be fooled by something pathetically dimwitted such as an age potion.
Go on Harry. Harry for goodness sake.

We've already been through enough people why don't you just go and do it yourself? Ughh. What do you want me to say again?
Ronald would like me to tell you that Seamus told him that Dean was told by Parvati that Hagrid was looking for you.
Uhhh...
Dean was told by Parvati that... Please don't ask me say it again. Hagrid's looking for you.
I'm NOT an owl!
Pssst! Harry? Is that you?
How are you feeling? OK? The key is to concentrate. After that you just have to...
Oh um.. Sorry I'll just go.
Your wand harry! Your wand!
Boys.

Look at this! I can't believe it she's done it again. Miss Granger a plain but ambitious girl seems to be developing a taste for famous wizards. Her latest prey sources report is none other than the Bulgarian bon-bon Viktor Krum. No word yet on how Harry Potter's taking this latest emotional blow.
They're not for Ginny they're for you! Dress robes.
It might interest you to know that Neville's already got someone.
Oh well spotted.
I won't be going alone because believe it or not someone's asked me. And I said yes.
What?
No of course.
She said yes??
Hot isn't it? Viktor's gone to get drinks. Care to join us?
What's got your wand in a knot?
The enemy?? Who was it wanting his autograph? Besides, the whole point of the tournament is international magical cooperation, to make friends.
How dare you! Besides I can take care of myself.
What? What? That's what you think?
You know the solution then don't you.
Next time there's a ball pluck up the courage and ask me before somebody else does, and not as a last resort.
Where have you been? Nevermind! Off to bed both of you.
Ron you spoil everything!
Harry you told me you'd figured the egg out weeks ago. The task is two days from now.
I wouldn't know, we didn't actually talk about the tournament. Actually we didn't really talk at all, Viktor's more of a physical being. I just mean he's not particularly... Mostly he watches me study. It's a bit annoying actually. You are trying to figure this egg out aren't you?
I mean these tasks are supposed to test you, in the most brutal way they're almost cruel. And um, I'm scared for you. You got by the dragon mostly on nerve, I'm not sure it's going to be enough this time.
Harry, tell me again.
The black lake, that's obvious.
Again obvious, though I must admit potentially problematic
Look Harry, we can do this. The three of us can figure it out.
But sir, the second task is only hours away and...
Harry!
Are you alright? You must be freezing! Personally I think you behaved admirably.
Next to last.
Bye.
No.
Everything's going to change now isn't it?
Promise you'll write this summer. Both of you.
Harry will won't you?

Harry!

Hello, Hagrid. Oh, it's wonderful to see you two again.

Oculus Reparo. Instantly, Harry's glasses are mended.
C'mon. Everyone's been so worried.

Isn't it thrilling! Gilderoy Lockhart's going to be there! We can actually meet him! I mean, he's written almost the whole booklist!

Fear of a name only increases fear of the thing itself.

I should think you'd count yourself lucky that's all you got.
Mandrake, or Mandragora, is used to return those who have been transfigured to their original state. It's also quite dangerous. The Mandrake's cry is fatal to anyone who hears it.

Immobilus!

I'm sure Professor Lockhart just wanted to give us some hands-on experience.
Rubbish. Read his books. You'll see all the amazing things he's done.
At least no one on the Gryffindor team had to buy their way in. They got in on pure talent.
Ron! Say something!


He called me a Mudblood.
It means dirty blood. Mudblood's a really foul name for someone who was Muggle-born. Someone with non-magic parents. Someone...like me. It's not a term one usually hears in civilized conversation.
Harry!
Voice? What voice?
'The Chamber of Secrets has been opened...?'
Look at that. Have you ever seen spiders act like that? Ron...?
That's why Ron and I went looking for him, Professor. We'd just found him when Harry said...
Harry. This voice. You said you heard it first in Lockhart's office?
And did he hear it?
I hardly think someone with Gilderoy Lockhart's credentials would lie to one of his students, Ronald. Besides, if you recall, we didn't hear anything either.
'Course we do. It's just... it's a bit weird, isn't it? You hear this voice and then... Mrs. Norris turns up Petrified.
No, Harry. Even in the wizarding world, hearing voices isn't a good sign.
Professor, I was wondering if you could tell us about the Chamber of Secrets?

Yes, Professor. But there seems to be very little written about the Chamber of Secrets. For those of us with a personal interest in the subject, that is... disturbing.

Muggle-borns.
Professor, what exactly does legend tell us lies within the Chamber?
Yes. Couldn't you tell: McGonagall's worried. All the teachers are.
The Heir of Slytherin has returned to Hogwarts. The question is, who is it?

If you're talking about him --
I heard him. But Malfoy? The Heir of Slytherin?
No. Even they aren't that thick. But there might be another way. Mind you, it would be difficult. Not to mention we'd be breaking about fifty school rules. And it would be dangerous. Very dangerous.
Here it is: 'The Polyjuice Potion. Properly brewed, the Polyjuice Potion allows the drinker to transform himself temporarily into the physical form of another...'
Yes.
Exactly. But it's tricky. I've never seen a more complicated potion. Lacewing flies, leeches, fluxweed. And, of course, we'll need a bit of whoever we want to change into too.
A month.
You didn't have to tell me that.
You're joking, right? Besides, even with a proper wand, it's too risky. You could hit Harry.

Finite Incantatem!

You will be able to, won't you?
Again? You mean, the Chamber of Secrets has been opened before?
Maybe. We'll have to wait for the Polyjuice Potion to know for sure.
Never. No one over comes in here.
Moaning Myrtle.
She's a little sensitive.
Do you think he's all right?
You can talk to snakes.
No. They can't. It's not a very common gift, Harry. This is bad.
I don't know, Harry. But it sounded like you were egging the snake on or something. It was... creepy.

Harry, listen out me. There's a reason the symbol of Slytherin house is a serpent. Salazar Slytherin was a Parselmouth. He could talk to snakes too.
He lived a thousand years ago. For all we know... you could be.

Harry!
You don't believe that, Harry, I know you don't. And if it makes you feel better, I just heard Malfoy's staying over for holiday, too.
Because, in a few days, the Polyjuice Potion's will be ready. In a few days... we may truly know who is the Heir of Slytherin.
Everything's set. We just need a bit of who you're changing into.
And we also need to make sure that the real Crabbe and Goyle can't burst in on us while we're interrogating Malfoy.
I've got it all worked out. I've filled these with a simple Sleeping Draught. Simple, but powerful.

You know how greedy Crabbe and Goyle are. They won't leave the Christmas Feast until every last drop of trifle is gone. Now, once they're asleep, hide them in a broom cupboard and pull out a few of their hairs.
I've already got mine.

Millicent Bulstrode. She's in Slytherin. I got this off her robes.
All right then... I'm going to check on the Polyjuice Potion.

Remember. Just make sure Crabbe and Goyle find these.

Did you get it?

I sneaked those out of the laundry.

I'm sure I've done everything right. It looks like the book said it should. Once we've drunk it, we'll have exactly one hour before we change back into ourselves.
We separate it into three glasses and add the hairs.



I -- I don't think I'm going. You go on without me.

Just go! You're wasting time!
Go away!


Do you remember me telling you the Polyjuice Potion was only for human transformations...?

It was cat hair I plucked off Millicent Bulstrode's robes! Look at my face!
Oh, good. Put those anywhere.

I've got to keep up, haven't I?

Any day now, according to Madam Pomfrey. I'm just thankful I've stopped coughing up fur balls.
Now. What about the Chamber of Secrets? Any new leads?
And has it gotten any better? I mean... is anyone speaking to you?
Of course not. I don't know how that got there. Now go. I still have six hundred pages to read in Transformation Through the Ages.
Tom Riddle... Hm. And Ron said he won an award fifty years ago?
Fifty years ago? You're sure?
Don't you remember what Malfoy told you? The last time the Chamber of Secrets was opened was --
Tom Riddle was here, at Hogwarts, when it happened. What if he wrote about what he saw? It's possible he knew where the Chamber was, how to open it, even what sort of creature lives in it. If so, whoever's behind the attacks this time wouldn't want a diary like this lying around, would they?
It might be invisible ink.
Aparecium!

I don't know, Harry. But I think you should be careful with this. Something tells me Ron might be right. It could be dangerous.
I'm scared, Harry. But not of you.
It can't be Hagrid. It just can't be.
Look. Hagrid's our friend. Why don't we just go ask him about it?
No!

It had to be a Gryffindor. Nobody else knows our password. Unless, it wasn't a student...
Harry... I think I've just understood something! I've got to go to the library!

You solved it! You solved it!
Oh, no!

Harry!
Oh, Harry! We've missed you! Are you furious with us, I bet you are!
Come on, inside. They enter an adjacent bedroom. INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT They sit down on separate beds.
Sorry we haven't written, Harry, but Dumbledore made us promise not to.
He was so angry when he heard. It was...scary...
Some of the Order are following known Death Eaters, like Lucious Malfoy.
And they're guarding something.
The Order of the Phoenix. Dumbledore started it last time to fight You-Know-Who. He only reorganized it after last term. Moments later, MRS. WEASLEY opens the door to their room.
They'll have to let you off, Harry... You were defending yourself! I checked the laws.
When you have to go to a disciplinary hearing at the Ministry of Magic, I'll hug you too.
Ronald Weasley, are you jealous?
Would you like a hug?
Harry, Ron and I, we've been named House Prefects! She hands Harry a letter. There are a few seconds of parchment ripping.
What about you, Harry? But there is no PREFECT BADGE in Harry's letter. He shakes his head.
Are you sure? I would have thought you would get one!
Well...thanks Harry.
I hope he's all right...
I wanted to know something about your course aims.
Well, I don't think they are. They say nothing about actually doing spells.
But surely the whole point of Defense against the dark arts is practical application?
No, but-
But we've got O.W.L.s coming up! You expect us to do the spells with no practice?
How can Dumbledore let that horrible woman teach? And when we're taking our OWL tests too!
Well, not us specifically, but definitely Dumbledore and the Order. At that moment, ANGELINA JOHNSON comes up to them.
Good luck, Harry.
Hey, Harry. He looks up from his parchment.
Have you seen Ron? I can't find him anywhere. Harry shakes his head.
He's been acting fishy all week. He's up to something. Harry packs up his parchments.
He's got to be taken to the hospital wing.
That old hag! She's sick! Hermione looks horrified.
Oh, Harry. You've got to go to Dumbledore. You can't keep this up.
Harry, I really think you should tell--
Hagrid's still not back yet. I hope he's all right.
Harry, you can't write to him! Owls are being intercepted, it isn't safe.
You think she's working for You- Know-Who?
I suppose so. He could have her under the Imperious Curse, though it's unlikely. Dumbledore'd know. Harry leans in even closer.
No, nothing.
Wait! Look at this!
"Trespass at Ministry. Sturgis Podmore has appeared before the Wizengamot with charges of trespass and attempted robbery at the Ministry of Magic on the 31st of August. He was arrested when found trying to break into a top-security door at one in the morning. Podmore was convicted and sentenced to six months in Azkaban."
Quiet!
What a load of rubbish!
You, ordering dungbombs. I mean, really.
Unless whoever tipped Filch off was interested in reading your mail, Harry. I mean, doesn't it seem a little too coincidental that Filch was tipped off when you happened to be sending a message to Sirius? Harry looks thoughtful.
I don't know. Just then Malfoy appears close by.
Are you all right, Harry?
I don't know how we're ever going to pass our O.W.L.s in Defense against the dark arts without any practice! That Umbridge woman is so... She looks at Harry and Ron.
We've got to do something about her. The boys stare at her.
Don't be silly, Ron. Not her, I meant her teaching. We're not going to learn anything in that class.
Anyway, I thought we should do it ourselves.
Defense Against the Dark Arts. We'd teach ourselves.
Keep reading.
Except he did mention that Dumbledore might not be in charge here much longer.
Well, that would explain why Umbridge isn't teaching us anything useful in Defense Against the Dark Arts.
What?
I cannot believe it! Harry and Ron glance at her. She slaps the paper down on the table.
It says here that the High Inquisitor has the power to inspect all of the teachers.
That's not all. The High Inquisitor also has the power to sack teachers as well. Fred and George march by.
There we are.
Come on, I'll explain in a minute.
These are some people I mentioned my Defense Against the Dark Arts idea with. She sits down. Harry and Ron follow.
Hi, everyone. I thought it would be good if we met and talked over how we wanted to teach ourselves Defense Against the Dark Arts.
Because we need to learn it properly, not the rubbish Umbridge is doing.
Obviously, this will help us pass our O.W.L.s, but more importantly, it gives us the ability to protect ourselves from...Lord Voldemort.
That's true, but I think we're drifting from the purpose--
Well...anyway...uh, I think that in order to learn properly we'll need a teacher.
So all in favor of taking lessons from Harry?
Where are we going to meet?
Ok, good.
I think we should put our names down, so we know who was here. Suddenly people look uncomfortable.
Honestly, Ernie, do you think I'd just leave it lying around? Besides, its enchanted.
Also, what should we call ourselves?
We need something that doesn't give away what we're doing.
Dumbledore's Army it is, then. The D.A. for short. Fred and George stand, along with Lee.
We'll let you know when we're going to meet. The meeting breaks up.
I think that went well.
And did you see Cho, Harry?
Well, she couldn't keep her eyes off you, could she?! Harry gives a little smile.
No, they couldn't have. The parchment we all signed was enchanted, like I said. No one can betray the D.A. without us knowing. Harry stops pacing and grins at Hermione.
She's hurt! Hedwig hoots softly.
Harry, you'd better take her to Professor Grubby-Plank. She'll know what to do. Harry scoops Hedwig up and runs through the portrait hole.
Harry, are you all right? He is helped to his feet by Fred and George.
I know something that could cheer you up.
Hagrid's back!
Was it because of the giants? There is a silence.
Professor Lockhart! Lockhart looks puzzled.
Told us what?
I never knew...Poor Neville.
That's got to be what Surgis Podmore was doing in the Ministry when he was arrested.
It makes perfect sense, Ron. It's got to be something the Ministry's been developing. Something top secret. Harry nods in agreement. Hermione picks up a copy of the Daily Prophet grimly.
Look at this. There's been a mass escape from Azkaban.
Yes. Harry grits his teeth.
Have fun, Harry. Meet me in The Three Broomsticks after. There's something you need to do.
Right, well, I figured that with all of the negative press out about Harry, he should have a chance to defend himself.
All of the details. What happened last summer. The truth about Sirius Black and Voldemort, not to mention the names of all the Death Eaters still on the loose. Rita leans across the table.
Well, it doesn't matter. We've found a publisher for the article.
Some won't believe Harry, that's true. But every person we do convince is one more ally. Rita shrugs, and pulls her quill from her bag.
So, Harry. Ready to tell the public the truth?
Fire away, Rita.
Look, Harry! It's your article!
Fan mail, Harry! Responses to the article.
She's done it to herself. Banning the article will only make people want to read it more!
Hagrid...we've been walking for a good hour.
We won't let her!
Of course we'll help.
Hagrid, I thought none of them wanted to come! Hagrid looks uncomfortable.
Oh, why, Hagrid? Why?
How do you know?
How'd Voldemort get into the Ministry of Magic without being seen? I mean, he and Sirius are the two most wanted wizards in the world...
It just seems so unlikely, Harry! Harry grabs her robes and glares at her.
Think, Harry! Voldemort knows you! He knows you'd rush off to save Sirius.
Yes, they can, Harry.
Before we do anything, we need to establish that Sirius really isn't at Headquarters. Which means we'll need to break into Umbridge's office. She smiles, and glances at Fred and George.
For that, we'll need a really good distraction. Fred and George grin.
Mind you, it's got to be really good!
We'll also need to keep everyone away from her office. Ginny brightens.
We'll probably only manage five minutes or so.
Break out your Invisibility Cloak, Harry.

Harry!
No! Please, stop! Umbridge looks pleased and turns to Hermione.
We have to tell her, Harry...
We were trying to find Professor Dumbledore. We had to tell him...
That it's ready. The weapon.
Oh, yes. It's very well hidden.
Don't call them that! Magorian ROARS in anger.
Grawp, help us! Grawp ROARS again and BEATS his CHEST.
I thought it worked out rather nicely.
I'd imagine we should fly.
There's nothing there, Harry.
Well, let's try a few. Harry nods.
There's no one here, Harry. This isn't the right room.

Harry... His eyes are locked on the veil. He walks closer.
Harry, I think we should leave. Harry reaches out his hand towards the veil.
Harry, we're here for Sirius, remember? Harry stops. He blinks and drops his hand.
I don't think Sirius is here. Ron stares at one of the orbs.
Don't touch it, Harry! Harry glares at her.
Stupify!
Colloportus! The door seals itself.
Harry, they went the wrong way!
Silenco! Stupify! The death eater falls silent, and then to the ground. Harry staggers to his feet, dazed.
Harry!
How are you doing, Harry? Harry pauses for a long moment, thinking.
Come on, let's go in to the feast. Harry shakes his head.
Take your time, Harry. We'll be here when you are.
He's a cat, Ronald! What do you expect? It's in his nature. As Harry reaches bottom, he finds RON WEASLEY protectively cradling Scabbers, while HERMIONE GRANDER does her best to restrain a HISSING Crookshanks.
That's rich coming from the owner of that smelly old shoe brush.
It's all right, Crookshanks. You just ignore the mean little boy...

Harry.
You know, the ancient Egyptians of the Nile River delta worshipped the cat goddess Bast.
Honestly, Ron, it's not funny. Harry's lucky he wasn't expelled.
Hi, Neville.

C'mon. We're in here.
Professor R.J. Lupin.
It's on his case.
Seems to be. Why? What is it, Harry?
But they'll catch Black, won't they? I mean... eventually?
Why're we stopping? We can't be there yet... Harry rises, slides open the door, peers into the corridor. HARRY'S POV -- All along the carriage, HEADS look out curiously. Then -- the train JERKS -- the car SWAYS -and the LAMPS running along the ceiling FLICKER and...
Ouch! Ron, that was my foot!
Harry? Harry, are you all right?
It was searching the train, Harry. For Sirius Black.
I was trembling. Cold. But then... Professor Lupin made it go away...
No one was screaming, Harry.
Of course! That's why he knew to give you the chocolate, Harry.

What rubbish.
Me? I've been here all along.
Death omens. Honestly. If you ask me, Divination's a very wooly discipline. Now Ancient Runes. That's a fascinating subject.

Don't be silly. How could anyone be in two classes at once?
Broaden your minds...
Hagrid. He's got to be taken to a hospital. I'll go with you, if you like -HAGRID No. I'm the teacher. You all... you all just... Class dismissed! And with that, Hagrid -- looking shaken -- swoops up Malfoy, flops him over his shoulder, and lumbers toward the castle.
Yes. But I hear Draco's father's furious. I don't think we've heard the end of this...
Achintee? That's not far from here...
Ron JUMPS, glances at Hermione, then WHISPERS to Harry.
Boggarts are shape-shifters. They take the shape of whatever a particular person fears most. That's what makes it so -
And the post office! It's about owls, all sitting on color- coded shelves, depending on how fast you want your letter to go!
But, I mean, after awhile, it got a bit boring. Don't you think, Ron?
But, sir, we've only just begun learning about Red Caps and Hinkypunks. We're not meant to start nocturnal beasts for weeks -
Please, sir, an Animagus is a wizard who elects to turn into an animal. A werewolf has no choice in the matter. Furthermore, the werewolf actively hunts humans and responds only to the call of its own kind -- Malfoy lets out a LOW HOWL.
No!!!
Harry! How're you feeling?
No one blames you, Harry. The Dementors aren't meant to come on the grounds. Dumbledore was furious. After he saved you, he sent them straight off.
It's meant to be the most haunted building in Britain. Did I mention that? Twice.
Should we move a bit closer? Huh?
Perfect.

Hope you don't mean yourself.
Harry...? Harry?
But Harry isn't going to keep it. He's going to turn it over to Professor McGonagall, aren't you?
Oh, shut up.
That's Madam Rosmerta. Ron fancies her.
That's a lie!
Harry. Will you explain to your friend Ronald that he has absolutely no proof whatsoever that my sweet, unassuming cat ate his shabby, decidedly decrepit rat.
How'd it go, Hagrid?
I meant the hearing.

And...?
You mustn't blame yourself, Hagrid.

Where's he going, Hagrid?
Here we go again. It's the Grim! It's the Grim!
I can't believe they're going to kill Buckbeak! It's too horrible.
You... foul... loathsome... evil... little cockroach...
That felt good.
We'll stay with you too, Hagrid.
What!
I think you owe someone an apology.
I meant me.
Nothing, I just thought I saw... Never mind.
Ron! No!
Harry. You do realize what tree this is...
I've got you -
Haaaaaaarrrrrr!!!!!!!!!
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
Thanks.
Where do you suppose this goes?
We're in the Shrieking Shack, aren't we?
Ron! You're okay -
If you want to kill Harry, you'll -- you'll... have to kill us, too!
Harry! No!
Professor Lupin!

No! I trusted you! I covered up for you. And all this time you've been his friend!
He's a werewolf! That's why he's been missing classes!
Since Professor Snape set the essay.
Harry. You attacked a teacher.
Don't worry. He's under the Somnambulist Charm. It's primarily used to transport the seriously deranged.
Harry...
Professor...?
Harry!
Harry -
What...?
Listen, Harry. They've captured Sirius. Any minute the Dementors are going to perform the Kiss.
It's what Dementors do to those they want to destroy. They clamp their jaws over the victim's mouth and... suck out his soul.
No. It's worse. Much worse. You go on living. But you have no memory. No sense of self. You're just a shall. An empty shell...
Headmaster! You've got to stop them! They've got the wrong man!
The point is... we know the truth. Please, sir, you must believe us.
Sorry, Ron. But seeing as you can't walk...
Seven-thirty. Where were we at seven-thirty?
Come on! We can't be seen!
This is a Time-Turner, Harry. McGonagall gave it to me first term. This is how I've been getting to my lessons all year.
Yes. Dumbledore wanted us to return to this moment. Clearly something happened he wants us to change.
Malfoy's coming!
Of course! Remember what Dumbledore said. If we succeed, more than one innocent life could be spared.
We'll see.
What?
No! Fudge has to see Buckbeak before we steal him. Otherwise, he'll think Hagrid set him free!
No, Harry! You can't!
Yes! You Must!
Harry, you're in Hagrid's hut right now. If you go bursting inside, you'll think you've gone mad. Awful things can happen when wizards meddle with time. We can't be seen.
Fudge is coming and... we're not leaving... why aren't we leaving?
Sorry.
C'mon. Any minute now we're going to be coming out the back door.
Is that really what my hair looks like from the back?
Nothing, I just thought I saw... Never mind.
Now, Harry!
Here, Beaky... Come and get the nice dead ferret... yum yum...
We save Sirius.
No idea.
Look. It's Lupin.
Here comes Snape.
Now we wait.
'Least someone's enjoying himself.
Yes?
With a Patronus. I heard Snape telling Dumbledore when we were taken to the hospital. According to him, only a really powerful wizard could have conjured it.
But, Harry, your Dad's...

Really?
It's happened. Lupin's transformed.
Saving your life.
OWWWWWWWW!

Why?
We've got to find him.
Poor Professor Lupin is having a really tough night...
This is horrible...
No one's coming, Harry... HE WILL!
No one's coming! You're dying, both of you... and no one's coming!
HARRY, NO!
No.
But I don't like this!
Out of the way!
Alohomora!
Didn't really expect that to work.
Dunamis! Liberare! Annihilare! Emancipare! No. No. No. No.
Quiet! I'm trying to think.
BOMBARDA!
We have to go.
What d'you think, Harry? Too much for him -- everything that's happened tonight?
It's a mystery. Though... this fell out of the wrapping.
Has anyone seen a toad? A boy named Neville has lost one.
Oh, are you doing magic? Let's see then.
Are you sure that's a real spell? Well, it's not very good, is it? I've only tried a few simple ones myself but they've all worked for me. For example ...
Goodness. You're Harry Potter, aren't you? I know all about you, of course. I was doing a little recreational reading and you're in Modern Magical History, The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts and Great Wizarding Events of the 20th Century.
Didn't you know? I'd have found out everything I could if it was me.
Anyway ... Oculus Reparo.
There. That's better, isn't it? I'm Hermione Granger, by the way. And you are ... ? ·

Pleasure. Do either of you know what House you'll be in? I'm hoping for Gryffindor--I hear Dumbledore himself was in it--but I think I might just die if they put me in Slytherin. That was You-Know- Who' s House. Anyway, you two had better change into your robes. I expect we'll be arriving soon. You've got dirt on your nose, by the way, did you know?
Well, he's rather disagreeable, isn't he?
It' s not real, the ceiling. It's only bewitched to look like the night sky. I read about it in Hogwarts, A History.
I hear he's a genius.
Oh dear. Here it is, isn't it? The moment. Goodness. What if the hat says nothing and we're all just left standing here forever ...
Nearly headless? How can you be nearly headless?
One hundred forty-two, though, in A History of Magic, Bathilda Bagshot makes unattributed reference to three others.
I've read about those. If the smoke turns red it means you've forgotten something.
Harry! No! You heard what Madame Hooch said. Besides you don't even know how to fly.
You won't make a fool of yourself.
It's in your blood.
We're not supposed to be here. This is the Third Floor. It's forbidden.
Because Dumbledore said so. Let's go.
Oh, move over. Alohomora!
Standard Book of Spells. Chapter Seven.
Shhh! Filch is... gone.
It was locked.
You don't use your eyes, do you? Didn't you see what it was standing on?
It was standing on a trapdoor, which means it's not there by accident. It's-
That's right. Now, if you don't mind, I think I'll go to bed before either of you figures out another clever way to get us killed. Or worse... expelled.
Honestly. You're going to take someone's eye out. Besides, you're saying it wrong. It's Levi-ohhhh-sa. Not· Levi-o-saaaah.
Wingardium Leviosa.
I heard that!
Is it--dead?
It's my fault, Professor McGonagall.
I went looking for the troll. I've read about them and thought I could handle it. But I was wrong. If Harry and Ron hadn't come along ... I'd be dead.
Ron's right, Harry. You're going to need your strength today.
That was ... disturbing.
Blood?
But why would anyone go near that dog?
So you're saying...
Well, whatever it is, it must be really valuable.
Bit early for mail, isn't it?
FOUL! FOUL! FOUL!

It's Snape. He's jinxing the broom.
Leave it to me. As Hermione dashes off, Ron turns the binoculars back to the sky. Harry hangs from the broom with two hands while Fred hovers nearby. George circles about ten feet below.

Nothing in the Quidditch rulebook discriminates against catching the Snitch in your mouth. Or any other place for that matter. In fact, in a game played in Greece in the late seventeenth century-
That thing has a name?
Hogwarts teacher or not, I know a jinx when I see one, Hagrid. I've read all about them. You've got to keep eye contact, and Snape wasn't blinking.
Oh my god! That' s barbaric !
I see you're not.
You can help Harry then. He promised to keep looking in the library for Nicolas Flamel over holiday.

Not in the Restricted Section.
I'll ask you again. What are the three most crucial ingredients in a Forgetfulness Potion?
And what, may I ask, do you plan to do should you get that question on final exams?
You will not. Besides, according to Professor McGonagall, we're to be given special quills bewitched with an anti-cheating spell.
Leg-Locker Curse.
Malfoy.
Follow me.
How could I be so stupid! I checked this out weeks ago for a bit of light reading.
Of course! Here it is!
Nicolas Flamel is the only known maker of the Sorcerer's Stone!
Oh, honestly, don't you two read?
The sorcerer's Stone is a legendary substance with astonishing powers. It will transform any metal in to pure gold, and produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal.
It means you'll never die.
The only stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicolas Flamel, the noted alchemist, who last year celebrated his six hundred and sixty-fifth birthday.
That's what Fluffy's guarding on the Third Floor. That's what's under the trapdoor. The Sorcerer's Stone!
Teaches at Hogwarts.
I don't want to scare you, Harry. It's just ... if all Snape wants is the Sorcerer's Stone ... why did he try to kill you that day on the Quidditch pitch?
Of course! There are other things defending the Stone, aren't there? Spells, enchantments...
Is that... a dragon?

Well, I for one, see nothing wrong with a reduced social life. It'll give us more time to revise for finals.
He won't be smiling tonight.
Haven't you heard? For detention they're taking us into the Dark Forest.
Well, that's good, isn't it? He'll be with his own kind. Better all around, don't you think? Especially for Fang.
Harry!
No. We're forgetting one thing. Who's the one wizard Voldemort always feared?
Dumbledore. As long as Dumbledore's around, you're safe, Harry. As long as Dumbledore's around...you can't be touched.
I'd always heard Hogwarts' end of year exams were frightful. But I found that rather enjoyable. Weren't you stunnei:l not to be asked about Elfric the Eager?
It's happened before...
Harry?
And with Dumbledore gone...
We were just...
What do we do now?
Neville. I'm really, really sorry about this.
Petrificus Totalus!
That was close.
We're coming.
The harp... what happened to the--
Stop moving! Both of you! This is Devil 's Snare! You have to relax.
I know, Harry. But you must. If you don 't, it'll only kill you faster.
Just relax.

Do what I say!
He's not relaxing, is he?
Devil's Snare, Devil's Snare. Dances in the dark, delights in the damp...
It's deadly fun, but will... sulk in the sun! That's it! Light! Devil's Snare. hates the light!
What is that?
Curious. I've never seen birds like these...
Locked.

So what do we do? There must be a thousand keys up there...
What's wrong with its wing?
Harry?
I don't like this. I don't like this at all.
But what're we to do?
What happens now?
Ron, you don't suppose this is going to be like real wizard's chess, do you?
What is it?
No. There has to be another way!
You're a great wizard, Harry Potter! You are, you know!
