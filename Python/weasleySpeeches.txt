What’s going on here, Neville?
You’ll have to forgive Remus. It takes its toll -- his condition.
We’re being followed, all of us. Molly doesn’t leave the house most days. It’s not been easy.
Yes, but I thought it best if I replied in person. If Dumbledore’s traveling, it’s news to the Ministry. But perhaps that’s the way Dumbledore wants it. As for Draco Malfoy -- I know a bit more.
I sent an agent to Borgin & Burkes. From what you describe, I think what you and Ron saw at the end of the summer -- the object that Draco seemed so interested in -- was a Vanishing Cabinet.
They were all the rage when Voldemort first rose to power. You can imagine the appeal. Should the Death Eaters come calling, one needed only slip inside and disappear for an hour or two. But they’re tricky contraptions. Require a tremendous amount of looking after. Eventually they fell out of favor.
Nothing. It’s still there.
Harry. You know, I went through all this before -- the last time around. Times like these -- dark times -- do funny things to people. It can bring them together and it can tear them apart. Things... speed up. It’s what happens when you don’t know if today will be your last.
Harry, no!

Ginny, stay with your mother! Without hesitation, she races for the reeds.
Haven't the foggiest, keep up!
Sorry Amos. Some of us had a bit of a sleepy start. This is Amos Diggory everyone, he works with me at the ministry. And this strapping young lad must be Cedric, am I right?
That's it sir, just over there.
Harry!
Let go kids!
Let! Go!
I bet that cleared your sinuses eh?
Well kids, welcome to the Quidditch World Cup!
Home sweet home.
Girls. Choose a bunk and unpack. Ron, get out of the kitchen we're all hungry.
Feet off the table.
Come on up, take your seats. I told you these seats would be worth waiting for.
Stop! Stop it. It's not the irish. We've gotta get out of here. Now.
Get back to the portkey everybody, and stick together. Fred, George... Ginny is your responsibility.
Stop! That's my son.
Ron, Harry, Hermione are you alright?
You can't possibly..
Barty, they're just kids.
Harry, who?
What a night! Nine raids! Nine!
Well now. Who are you?
Good Lord, are you really? Ron's told us all about you, of course. When did you get here?
Did you now! How'd it go?!
I... I mean... That was very wrong, boys. Very wrong indeed. So, Harry. You must know all about Muggles. Tell me, what exactly is the function of a parking meter?

Dumbledore must know you're here, Harry. Doesn't miss a trick, that man.
So you're dentists! Fascinating! I understand other Muggles quite fear you? Why is that?
Ron! Harry! It's mad in here. Let's go outside.

Lucius.
We have a very different idea about what disgraces the name of wizard, Lucius.
If he keeps it up, he might end up in Azkaban. And that would give You- Know-Who a clear field to--

Probably just nerves...
Well, come on, Harry. Time to go.
Good, good, not very many Muggles.
Well, come on Harry, in we go.
I do love using the Fellytone! Now, let's see, what's the number again... He punches in SIX, TWO, FOUR, FOUR, TWO.
Harry Potter, disciplinary hearing.
Usually I Apparate, but you're too young, so I thought we'd take the scenic route.
Keep close, Harry!
Ah, Perkins, good morn-
Blast! Dumbledore thought they might try that.
Good lord, that was five minutes ago! Come on, Harry!
Yep, I've got no idea what they get up to in here, it's top secret.
Come on, Harry!
Now, Harry, I find that highly unlikely...
There you are, Harry, in you go...good luck... Harry enters the chamber. INT. COURTROOM - DAY One side of the courtroom is an elevated zigarat-shaped series of seats carved from black stone.
Harry, you've been let off! That's wonderful! The door opens again and the whole of the Wizengamot exits.
You were tried by the full court?
Well, no matter. Let's go home.
Ah...yes...I'm afraid we had a bit of a row. He, well, he sided with Fudge and the rest of us sided with Dumbledore, so Percy left.
Dunno, Harry. Some things are just beyond comprehension.
Settle down, you three!
Sirius, we saw Fudge talking with Lucius Malfoy on Level Nine again. Tell Dumbledore, next time he comes in, would you?
Well, I'd better be off. I've got a bewitched vomiting toilet to deal with.
Also, I'm covering for Tonks on guard duty later tonight, so I won't be back until late.
Hullo, everyone! Mrs. Weasley bends down and kisses Arthur.
That's my own business.
Come on, Harry!
Now, Harry, I find that highly unlikely...
NOT MY DAUGHTER, YOU BITCH!
Back off, boys! She’s mine!
You will never touch my children again!
Harry! Hagrid! What happened?! Have you seen the others?
Well, thank goodness you two are all right.
My boy! My darling boy! What’ve they done to you?!
What is it, Ginny? Is it your father? Has something happened at the Ministry? Has he been kidnapped? Is it the Death Eaters?
You’re worse than Fred and George.
Harry who?
I think I’d know if Harry Potter was in my house, wouldn’t I?
I seriously doubt that.

Harry!

But why didn’t you tell us you were coming?
That man. But then, what would we do without him? Ron!
Eat up, eat up, everyone! There’s more to come!
You’re sure you won’t stay?


WHERE... HAVE... YOU... BEEN?!

Harry! How wonderful to see you.
Beds empty! No note! You could've died! You could've been seen!
I don't blame you, of course, dear.
You best hope I don't put bars on your window, Ronald Weasley!
Care for a spot of tea, Harry?

This morning. Your sons flew that enchanted car of yours to Surrey house and back last night.
That must be Errol with the post. Fetch him, will you, George?

We'll manage. Right then. There's only one place to get all of this.
You first, Harry dear.

Percy. Would you mind going first, so Harry can see how it's done?
Remember to speak clearly, dear!
Oh, Harry. Thank goodness. We hoped you'd only gone one grate too far. Come now. We're off to Flourish and Blotts.
There he is!
Oh dear! The train'll be leaving any moment! All together now!

Go on, Ginny. You know what to do.


Come, Ginny. We'll get you a seat.

RONALD WEASLEY! HOW DARE YOU STEAL THAT CAR! I AM ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTED! YOUR FATHER'S NOW FACING AN INQUIRY AT WORK AND IT'S ENTIRELY YOUR FAULT! IF YOU PUT ANOTHER TOE OUT OF LINE WE'LL BRING YOU STRAIGHT HOME!
Oh, and Ginny dear. Congratulations on making Gryffindor. Your father and I are so proud.

A diary that writes back to you! Honestly, Ginny! What were you thinking? Haven't I always told you? Never trust anything that can think for itself if you can't see where it keeps its brain!

Hello, Harry dear.
Sirius, the meeting is about to start!
Harry, dear, go on upstairs- quietly, if you please. They're all up there. Harry looks up the stairs.
You can come down now, the meeting's over. They stand up to go. INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT Harry, Ginny, Hermione, Ron, and Mrs. Weasley enter the KITCHEN, which has been set up with long tables and chairs.
Arthur-
And that was quite right, Harry! You're much to young--
It's not your decision!
He's not an adult either!
He's not James.
I only have Harry's best interests at heart.
Who else does he have, then? Sirius stands, glaring at Mrs. Weasley.
Morning, dear! Did you have a good sleep?
Good luck, Harry! She hugs Harry.
Your father's alive. He's going to make it. There is relief evident on all of their faces. Harry turns and leaves, re-entering the kitchen.
This way, come on!
Don't be silly, Harry. You too. And she ushered him inside.
How are you, dear?
That's enough! She looks at Arthur.
Moody and Tonks are outside, Arthur. They'd like a word. She looks at her children.
All of you, out, if you please. They turn and leave. Mr Weasley calls Harry back.
Yes. You know, Dumbledore seems like he's been waiting for something like this to happen. When I spoke to him this morning, he seemed very worried about Harry.
Are you all right, Harry dear? You look like you're going to be sick.
It's good to see you, Harry.
She hands Scabbers through the open window to him.

...packed with Muggles, of course.
All right, Percy. You first.
Fred. You next.
Sorry, George.
How to get onto the platform? Not to worry, dear. It's Ron's first time to Hogwarts as well.
All you have to do is walk straight at the barrier between Platforms Nine and Ten. Focus ... but don't stop and don't be scared you'll crash into it either. Best do it at a bit of a run if you're nervous.
Fred! George! Come say goodbye to Ginny. Mrs. Weasley stands waving, the redheaded girl clinging to her dress. The twins take one last look at Harry, dash off.
Certainly not. The boy isn't something you goggle at in a zoo.
All right, on you go, all of what is that on your nose?
You two watch out for your brother. And behave yourselves this year. If I get one more owl teeling me you've blown up a toilet or something--
Fleur’s seeing to Ollivander. Anyone else need tending -
It was our Aunt’s. We used to come here as kids. The Order uses it now as a safe house -- what’s left of us, at least.
You’re leaving, aren’t you.
And Griphook?
Listen, I don’t know what you’re up to, but I know goblins. If you’ve struck any kind of bargain with Griphook, you must be exceptionally careful to live up to it. If you don’t... he won’t be forgiving.
Hello, Harry. Bill Weasley.

True enough. Owe it all to a werewolf by name of Greyback. Hope to repay the favor one day.
Mad-Eye’s dead.
Mundungus took one look atVoldemort and Disapparated.
Oh, yes... of course.
Certainly, Mother. Don't worry, Harry. It's simple enough.

Diagon Alley.

Hello, Sir Nicolas.
I happen to be a prefect. You, on the other hand, have no business wandering the corridors at night. It's not safe these days.

What're your names again?
Mind your attitude, Malfoy. You want to show a little bit more respect to a school Prefect!
Minister, I saw him! You-Know-Who! He was right there!

Let me through, please. Excuse me, thank you, I'm Head Boy...
Back! All of you! No one is to enter this dormitory until it has been fully searched!
Have to go, Mother. The other Prefects are expecting me up front.
Hm? Oh. Professor Snape. Head of Slytherin House
Potions. But everyone knows it's the Dark Arts he fancies. Been after Quirrell's job for years.
Hello, Sir Nicolas. Have a nice summer?
This is the most direct path to the dormitory, except on Fridays, of course, when the staircases change.

Gryffindors, I givee you Peeves, Hogwarts resident poltergeist

Rather a nuisance, I'm afraid. Ah. Here we are.
Caput Draconis.
Girls' dormitory to the left. Boys to the right. You'll find your belongings have already been brought up. Any questions?
Then, goodnight all. Oh, and don' t forget. Before retiring, please place all living potion ingredients in your cupboards. This includes slugs, fire beetles and cutworms. Sweet dreams...
My youngest brother, you know!
Nice night for it! Harry turns to Luna. Okay, Luna. mind?
Wasn’t always this handsome.
Well, none of us really fancy it, mate.
Have a lot of experience with that, do you, Mad-Eye?
Just trying to defuse the tension.
Wow -- we’re identical!
Yes, don’t fancy this color at all.
How do you feel, Georgie?
Come again?
With the whole wide world of ear- related humor at your disposal, you go for holey? Pathetic.
Better.
Brilliant!
Step up! Step up!
Nosebleed Nougats...
Puking Pastilles!
Into the cauldron, handsome.

What’d you think, Harry?
We’ve got eyes in the back of our heads.

A real money spinner that.
Handy if you need to make a quick escape. Hello, ladies!

Then again, the way we hear it, sis, you’re doing just fine on your own.
Are you not currently dating Dean Thomas?

Aren’t they now. Pygmy Puffs. Can’t breed them fast enough.

Five Galleons.
Five Galleons.
Ten Galleons.
That isn't just any old manky boot mate.
It's the Irish!
Sounds like the irish have got their pride on.
Wicked.
Cooked it up just this morning.
Oh yeah? And why's that Granger.
So?
Ready George?
Lose a leg.
Pack it in altogether.
Alright everyone, go back to your knitting. This is gonna be uncomfortable enough without all you nosey sods listening in.

Try saying that five times faster.
All that moral fibre eh?
Hurry! Let's nip inside before Mum wakes up!

This lot won't come cheap, Mum. The spellbooks alone...
Diagon Alley!
Make way for the Heir of Slytherin! Seriously evil wizard coming through!

FRED, GEORGE, AND GINNY
He got off, he got off, he got off! Hermione hugs Harry again. Ron glowers at her.
George, remember that concept. Vomiting Toilet.
Umbridge did this?
So, seen the news have you?
Well, we'll expect a full report after.
Hear, hear!
Can't forget that he saved the Sorcerer's Stone from You-Know-Who in his first year.
You don't even care! You wouldn't even understand! Sirius stares at him incredulously.
How come they haven't taken them off, then?
You were guarding it, weren't you? This weapon thing?
Right you are, Hermione. Think we can whip something up, George?
Just give us a few seconds.
It's been too quiet around here anyway.
Right. You've got ten minutes to get to Umbridge's office. And whatever you do, stay away from the Astronomy Tower for the next couple of hours.
That was worth it! Filch steps back around the corner, grinning evilly.
Thank you for playing, one and all.
Fairly amusing, yeah.
This was never your school! Hogwarts is Dumbledore's school! There is a loud cheer from the students filling the hall. Umbridge looks around, livid with rage.
George, I think we've outgrown full- time education. Wouldn't you agree?
Time to enter the real world?
Accio brooms!
We won't be seeing you.
Be sure to visit us at our new premises on Diagon Alley!
No, not a soul. Unless you count Tom. The day maid. The night maid. The cook. The bloke that came to fix the toilet. That wizard from Belgium...
George's nose looks positively massive in that photograph.
Bloody hell. 'Tis, isn't it? Take after your side of the family, don't I, Mum?
Peaky? What d'you expect him to look like? He fell fifty feet.
Gave us a right good scare, mate.
Clever, Harry.
Besides, we've got a better way.
Rubbish he says. That there's the secret to our success.
But we've decided your need's greater than ours. George, if you will...
Dumbledore.
Pacing.
Everyone.
Where they are.
Every minute.
Nicked it from Filch's office, of course, first year. Now listen. There's seven secret passageways out of the castle. But we'd recommend...
This one.
Witch, right. But you best hurry. Filch is heading this way.
Oh. And, Harry? When you're done, make sure to give it a tap and say, 'Mischief managed.' Otherwise, anyone can read it.
What's wrong?
I'm not Fred I'm George. Honestly, woman, you call yourself our mother?
Only joking. I am Fred.
Harry Potter.
Mum! Guess who's on the train? Right now...
Harry Potter!
Blown up a toilet? We've never blown up a toilet.
Well done, Harry. Wood's just told us.
Brutal. But no one's died in years Someone will vanish occasionally...
Just in case you fall, George will...
... catch you.
Don't worry, you three. This'll all blow over.
Dead ugly.
Yeah, imagine if something went wrong and we were stuck as scrawny, specky gits forever.
Wow -- we’re identical!
Don’t have something a bit more sporty, do you?
Saint-like.
Saint-like... You see, I’m holy. Holey, Fred, geddit?
Reckon I’m still better-looking than you. Better-looking thanBill, that’s for sure.
’Ear, ’ear.
Morning.
Bloody hell, what’s the Minister of Magic doing here?
Step up! Step up!
We’ve got Fainting Fancy...
And just in time for school...
Into the cauldron, handsome.


Pocket that and you’ll pay in more than Galleons, my friend.
We’ve got eyes in the back of our heads.

Bloody urchins.
Yes, they do really work.
Five Galleons.
Five Galleons.
Ten Galleons.
It's a portkey.
Come on!
Here come the Bulgarians!
Yes!
That's rubbish! You don't know what you're doing!
Thank you thank you, well lads we've done it.
That's why it's so brilliant.
Ready Fred?
You said..
We knew you wouldn't die Harry.
Or an arm.
Well done 'moral fibre'.
Dad's home!

It's our Hogwarts letters! And look. They've sent Harry's as well.
Diagon Alley!
HARRY! WATCH OUT!

Not to mention they're dead terrified Harry'll Petrify them if they fly anywhere near him.
FRED, GEORGE, AND GINNY
He got off, he got off, he got off! Hermione hugs Harry again. Ron glowers at her.
Right you are, Fred.
Personally, I envy you three.
Umbridge is inspecting McGonagall in your period. That old toad won't know what hit her. He looks at Fred wistfully.
Oh, to be a youth again, to experience the innocent glee of watching Umbridge be destroyed by the greatest Head of Gryffindor this century.
Complete with facial expressions. And they wander off.
Dumbledore believes he is.
We can go where we please.
That's our father out there dying!
What were you doing when it happened, dad?
Might be able to.
Not to worry, Hermione. We've got something that will outdue everything else we've done here combined.
Time we did some real damage to this place.
Unless they spread, in which case, I'd get out of the castle for a while. They leave. Hermione turns to Harry.
And now, we've got to go! They turn and vanish down another hallway.
You know, I don't think we are.
Completely, Fred.
Definitely. Together they raise their wands.
Accio brooms!
Yeah, don't bother writing.
Not flashing that clipping about again, are you, Ron?
Yeah, c'mon, Ron. We'll walk you off the Astronomy Tower and see how you come out looking.
But not clever enough.
It's a wrench giving it to you, believe me.
I solemnly swear that I am up to no good. George touches his wand to the parchment and INTRICATE INK LINES surface in the fiber of the paper, spread like veins. Harry reads the CURIOUS WORDS at the top:
Ah... Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs. We owe them so much.
In his study.
Does that a lot.
Everyone.
What they're doing.
Of every day.
This one.
What's wrong?
Want a hand?
Oy! C'mere, Fred! Take a handle.
Blimey. You're...
Harry Potter!
Great idea, though, thanks, Mum!
Our job to make sure you don't get bloodied up too bad. Can't make any promises, of course. Rough game, Quidditch.
But they turn up in a month or two.
What's football?
It may take a year or two, but eventually people will start talking to you again.
Harry! What’re we going to do? We can’t just leave Hermione alone with her!
We have to do something, Harry!
Let her go! Let her go!
Works for me.
Shell Cottage on the outskirts of Tinworth.
Trust me.
Sss.
Like hell!
Expelliarmus!

All right!
Then you’re on our side.
Who put it there? The fake.
And if we find one? How’re we supposed to destroy it if we’ve given Griphook the sword?
You’re sure it’s hers?
You heard Ollivander. It’s Harry’s now.
How will we know what it is when we get in there? After all, a Horcrux can be anything.
That’s a bit scary.
Always good value. I’ll miss her.
What d’you think?
You want to tell me what that is?
You mean he could see you?
Go on.
Bloody hell... that’s a sight.
Hideous.
Couldn’t do anything about that bit in the back that’s always flipping up, could you? Dead annoying -
Never mind. I’m good. (peering warily at her) That is you in there, isn’t it?
Hey. Easy.
What do you mean?
Harry, what do we do? Harry...?
What’s that? Up ahead.
You don’t say. (as the cart’s alarms
Imperio!
No. It’s not possible...
Bloody hell. That’s a Welsh
It’s been trained to expect pain when it hears the noise.
Blimey...
Is it here, Harry? Can you feel anything?
Keep going!
The cup!
Foul little git. Least we’ve got Bogrod.
That’s unfortunate.
You’re asking us? You’re the brilliant one.
That’s your idea?
That was brilliant! BRILLIANT!
Bloody hell.
I say we jump!
He’s going to make sure the other
What happens when he finds out four are gone?
What?
‘Fraid he’s right. One problem: Snape’s Headmaster now. We can’t just walk in the front door.
Maybe it’s because of the Horcruxes. Maybe he’s growing weaker. Maybe he’s dying.
What’s he mean by that?
Did you get a look at him! For a second I thought it was -
Who’s that with her? Bloody hell...
I don’t remember this being on the Marauder’s Map.
Oh, bloody hell. Here we go.
Excuse me. But would someone tell me: what’s a bloody diadem?
Six months she hasn’t seen me and it’s like I’m Frankie First Year. I mean, I’m only her brother.
Shut up, Seamus.
Harry, Hermione and I have been thinking. It doesn’t really matter if we find the Horcrux.
So we were thinking -
You destroyed Tom Riddle’s Diary with a Basilisk fang, right? Well, we know where we might find one, don’t we?
Take me inside.
Harry talks in his sleep. Haven’t you noticed?
I’ve never got this far before. I’m scared.

What did you expect it to be like? Not this.
You do it.
Yes, you can.
Bloody hell. We’ll never find him
What?
Brilliant.
He must’ve gone into the Room of Requirement. It doesn’t show on the map, remember? You said so last year.
Let’s go.
RUN! Goyle’s set the bloody place on fire!
Serves him right.
He’s joking, right? Then Harry sees them, perched atop a fragile, crumbling tower. Harry whips his broom around and jets forth. Ron shakes his head, then jets after, BELLOWING:
IF WE DIE FOR THEM, I’LL KILL YOU, HARRY!
Brilliant.
You’re bloody well welcome!
Prat. Ron looks back, to Hermione, and follows her gaze to Harry, who stares into the distance, his face still bearing traces of the agony he’s just endured.
Where will he take her?
Look inside him, Harry.
Find out where he is. If we find him, we find the snake. Then we’re one step closer to ending this.
He’s gone. The snake too.
Never! Do you hear me! NEVER!
We thought you’d gone to the forest, we thought you might be -
Are you mad! No!
Rubbish! You can’t just give yourself up to him -
Liar!
He saved your life.
Well done, Malfoy!
Can’t believe I just said that.
Hermione!
I need to tell you something!
Not exactly leaving the place better than we found it, are we?
But that means...
What do you reckon we should do with it?
I’m just saying. That’s the Elder Wand! It’s the most powerful bloody wand in the world! With that, we could, we could -
What are those?
C’mon. Mum’s got dinner ready.
Never done that before, have we?

I knew Ginny was lying about that tattoo.
Hey ya -- Well... thanks.

Always the tone of surprise.

Going somewhere?
For you? You think Mad-eye died for you? You think George took that curse for you? You may be the Chosen One, mate, but this is a whole lot bigger than that.
And leave Hermione? Are you mad? We wouldn’t last two days without her.
Don’t tell her I said that. (back to Harry) Besides, you’ve still got theTrace on you. And there’s the wedding...
Bill and Fleur. Mum’s been planning it for months. Only thing that’s kept her sane, Ir eckon. She’ll kill me if I miss it. Kill you too. Rather go face to face with You-Know-Who if I’m honest.
Tonight’s not the night, mate. You’d only be doing him a favor.
Do you think he knows?
I mean, they’re bits of his soul, the Horcruxes. Bits of him. When Dumbledore destroyed the ring and you destroyed Tom Riddle’s diary all those years ago -- he must’ve felt something right?
What I’m saying is, if we do this thing right, if we find the Horcruxes and begin to destroy them one by one...
Won’t he know he’s being hunted?
Dunno. But something tells me he didn’t come to give away the bride.
Dumbledore? And me? I dunno. I reckon I was just another Weasley to him. He was always polite --
Dumbledore left this? For me? Brilliant. Er -- what is it?
Wicked.
Mum used to read me those! The Wizard and the Hopping Pot, Babbitty Rabbity and her Cackling Stump...
Oh, c’mon! Beedle’s stories are famous! Babbity Rabbitty? No...?
The Ministry has fallen. The Minister of Magic is dead. They are coming...
Where are we?
How the ruddy -
You’re amazing, you are.
They were after you, mate. We’d just put everyone in danger going back.
What she said.

So where do we go from here? The Leaky Cauldron?
By the way -- these jeans? Not my favorite. Bit tight.
This is Dolohov. I recognize him from the wanted posters.
So what do we do with you, huh? Kill us if it was turned round, wouldn’t you?
Suppose it’s him that did Mad-Eye. How would you feel then?
You’re the boss.
Hermione?
You’re the best with spells.
Can’t be. The Trace breaks at seventeen. It’s Wizarding law.
What?
We’ve got to get off the streets, get somewhere safe.
What was that about?

Tell him from me he’s a

Hey! I think you two better comedown here.
The two clinging to the tree areDeath Eaters for sure. Dunno ‘bout the bloke on the bench.
Can’t see us, of course. But we’ll have to be careful coming and going. C’mon. There’s something else you need to see.
R... A... B.
R.A.B. was Sirius’ brother? We see the trio from the strange LOW POV again, sitting round the kitchen table. SLOPPY STACKS of OLD DAILY PROPHETS surround them.
Kreacher...
You’re a thief, Dung. Everyone knows it.
Wicked trainers.
Piece of advice. Let’s not rehash old times. Got it... mate?
No. He’s worried he should have got more money for it.
Right.So let’s do it. Who gets who? *
The world’s mental. Come on, drink up. We’ve got a Horcrux to find.
In case you’re interested, I’m Reg Cattermole, Magical Maintenance Department.
Oh... yeah. Thanks.
What do you reckon he meant by ‘Good luck.’?
We flush ourselves in?
That’s bloody disgusting.
I gotta tell you, I'm starting to freak out a bit.
hey’re not Ministry. They’reSnatchers. They hunt Muggle-borns and blood-traitors for a price.
Really? Have you tried an umbrella?
Downstairs...?
Oh my god. What am I going to do? My wife’s all alone downstairs?
Oh. Right.
No, that’s mad. You two find Umbridge. I’ll be fine. But how do I stop it raining?
Finite Incantatem, okay. And if that doesn’t work...?
M-morning.
Harry! Blimey, I forgot what you looked like. Where’s Hermione?
Bloody cold down here.
What is it?
‘Tis, isn’t it? This’ll be one to tell the kids.
Mary. Go home. Get the kids. I’ll... I’ll meet you there. We have to get out the country, understand?
Mary! Do as I say!
I’m sorry. It’s just -
Long story. Nice meeting you.
Piss off.
No, don’t! Don’t say it!
It’s taboo -- You-Know-Who’s name. That’s how they track people now. It’s how they found us in the cafe that night.
I overheard a bloke from the Enforcement office talking about it at the Ministry. Blimey, what’s that smell?
Not bloody likely. Smells like something Ginny would cook.
Is that it?
... alive.
It’s angry.
Seems strange, mate. Dumbledore sends you off to find a load of Horcruxes, but doesn’t bother to tell you how to destroy them. Doesn’t that bother you?
I’m hungry.
I’m hungry.

Leave it.
Mum can make food appear out ofthin air.

Oh, speak English, can’t you?
I said leave it.
Yeah. Brilliant. Only, correct me if I’m wrong... wasn’t that yesterday’s plan? And the day before that? And the day before that? Walk. Sleep. Walk. Sleep.
He doesn’t know what he’s doing, does he? A frown creases Hermione’s forehead as she studies Ron, then she glances at Harry, a trace of doubt in her eyes.
Wizards were here.
The sword was stolen.
Yeah, I’m still here. But you two carry on. Don’t let me spoil your fun.
Problem? There’s no problem. Not according to you, anyway.
All right, I’ll spit it out. Don’t expect me to skip up and down because now there’s some other damn thing we’ve got to find.
Yeah, I thought I did too.
No, I just reckoned after all this time, we’d have actually achieved something. I reckoned you knew what you were doing. I reckoned Dumbledore had told you something worthwhile! I reckoned you had a plan!
Yeah, and we’re about as near getting rid of it as we are to finding the rest of them, aren’t we!
Don’t lie! You said it, too, you said you were disappointed -
Do you know why I listen to that radio, every night? Do you! To make sure I don’t hear Ginny’s name or Fred or George or Mum or -
NO! YOU DON’T KNOW WHAT IT’S LIKE! YOUR PARENTS ARE DEAD! YOU HAVE NO FAMILY!
And you?
Are you staying? Or coming?
Fine. I get it. I saw you two the other night. Yeah, that’s right. Didn’t know I knew, did you?
Are -- you --mental?
Well, yeah. Bit obvious, I'd think.
No. I reckoned it was you.
Right. Antlers.
No, I... I did think maybe I saw something -- when I was running -- over there --
Anything?
And we did, didn’t we?
What? No. Harry. That thing’s bad for me. I can’t handle it. I’m not making excuses for how I acted, but that thing affects me more than it affects you and Hermione. It made me think stuff -- stuff I was thinking anyway, but it made everything worse.
No. I can’t --
I’m sorry. I’m sorry I left.
Saving your life.
And just think of it. Only three to go.
Hey.
Wo -- hey -- ouch!
How come he’s got your wand?
No, of course not. I only destroyed a bloody freaking Horcrux! Why would that change anything! Do you know what it was like for me to hear those words coming from you! To see you doing those things -
Look, I wanted to come back the minute I’d left. I just... didn’t know how to find you.
With this.
It doesn’t just turn off lights. I don’t know exactly how it works, but Christmas morning I -- I was sleeping -- in this little pub-- I’d given some Snatchers the slip the night before, me being a blood- traitor and all -- anyway, I was sleeping when I heard it...
A voice.
Your voice, Hermione. Coming out of this.
My name. Just my name. Like a whisper.
So I took this and I clicked it and this tiny ball of light appeared. And I knew.
Just knew. On account of Hermione’s voice. And sure enough, it floated toward me, the ball of light, right to my chest and then -- went straight through-- right here.
I could feel it inside me. It was warm, like the first sip of a good cup of tea. And I knew it would take me where I needed to go. So I Disapparated and came out on this hillside. It was dark. I didn’t have any idea where I was. I just had to hope one of you would show yourselves in the end. And you did.
I’ve always liked it. These flames Hermione makes.
How long you reckon she’ll stay mad at me?
It was true. Every word.
You’re going to think I’m mental, but I think that’s why Dumbledore left it to me -- the Deluminator. I think he knew that at some point I’d... need to find my way back. And she’d lead me.
Bloody hell. I just realized.
Well, I’ve got one. Here. It’s Blackthorn, ten inches, nothing special, but I reckon it’ll do. I took it off a Snatcher a few weeks back.
Don’t tell Hermione, but they’re a bit dim, Snatchers. This one was definitely part Troll. The smell off him...
Wo.
Nothing.

Maybe a bit more practice, eh?
All right.
But what does it mean?
I think Hermione’s right. I think we ought to go and see Lovegood. What say we vote on it? Those in favor...
Sorry, Harry. Looks like it’s Hermione and me this time.
Luna?
Keep off the dirigible plums.
Aren’t you the one who keeps telling everyone it’s their first duty to help Harry?
He’s mental. Let’s face it. Luna’s always good value, but she’s nutty as squirrel poo.
Well, yeah, of course. It’s massive, isn’t it?
Yeah, all right...
The what?
Yes. No.
Midnight. Mum always said midnight.
But twilight’s fine. Better actually.

Let’s get out of here once he’s back. I’m not touching this stuff, hot or cold.
The Cloak. The Stone.
You’re supposed to say the Cloak, but who wants to spend all day being invisible. Dead boring if you ask me. But an unbeatable wand!
Yeah, but imagine what a short wicked life you’d lead.
Not like Harry’s. I’ve seen a fair few. Dad used to bring home the ones the Ministry confiscated from petty thieves and the like. They always got holes or tears. Harry’s is different. It’s perfect.
You forgot the water.
For the tea.
Nooooooooo!
That treacherous old bleeder! Is there no one we can trust!
I’ll do the enchantments.
Don’t touch her!
Stan Shunpike.
Weasley...
Barney Weasley.
Piss off! Arthur Weasley’s ten times the wizard you are!
Harry? Did someone say Harry?
‘Course not. Think I’d know if my best friend was in my room, wouldn’t I?

Harry!

You’ve a bit of...
Mum sort of lost it last week. Said Ginny and I had no business going back to Hogwarts. That it’s too dangerous.
Anyway, Dad stepped in, told her she was being barmy. Took a day or two, but she came round.
A hundred and fifty. Give or take a few years.

How much for this?
How much for me?
But I’m your brother!
C’mon. Let’s go.
Hi.
Fred reckons people need a laughthese days.
Is it just me? Or do Draco and mummy look like two people who don’t want to be followed?
What’re they playing at?
(a nod; stopping) Hey. Where’s Hermione?
Harry, where is she?
Sorry.
One of what?
You’re barking. What would You-Know- Who want with a sod like Malfoy?
It’s a creepy shop. bloke. He’s a creepy
Probably on the platform. C’mon.
Don’ you worry. He’ll be ‘long soon ‘nuff --
Oi! Turn around, you lunatic.
Looks like his own this time.
(shrugging; still

That was cheerful.
But I don’t want to take Potions!
Ron Weasley, sir. But I’m dead awful at Potions, a menace actually, so I probably should just be going -
Hard feelings?
Really? Strapping guy like you, you’ve got a Beater’s build, don’t you think? Keeper needs to be agile, quick --
Have to admit, thought I was going to miss that last one. Hope Cormac’s not taking it too hard.

Has a bit of a thing for you, Hermione. Cormac.
Not bloody likely. He’s top of the class. Even better than you, Hermione. Slughorn thinks he’s a genius.

What?
The who?

Yeah. Right.
Well, it’s true. I like a nice chat before I go to bed. Now you’re always reading that bloody book. It’s like being with Hermione. This time it’s Hermione’s turn to glare.
-The library.
Spider? About six feet tall? Ten feet wide?
Barking. Does he not remember that raving arachnid tried to eat us? What?

O-kay.
Aw, bloody hell...
I’d like to leave.
That happens to be my sister.
What’re you playing at?
Get to know him?
Um... You’ve got a little...
Bit worried about her. Did you hear that rubbish she was talking back in the pub? Her and me snogging. Ha. As if...
Harry, she’s swallowing her tongue --
Believe me, Professor, I’ve been asking myself the same question for six years.
What do you suppose Dean sees in her? Ginny.
He’s brilliant.
Yeah, well, he was running his hands all over my sister, wasn’t he? Something snaps. You’ve got to hate him. You know, on principle.
So what is it? He sees in her?
You know.
Skin? You’re saying Dean’s dating my sister because of her skin?
Hermione’s got nice skin. Wouldn’t you say? As skin goes, I mean.
Right.
So. How was it?

Your dinner party.
I expect you’ll be going with McLaggen. Isn’t he a member of the Slug Club?
Really?
I’m resigning. After today’s match. McLaggen can have my spot.

Sure...

C’mon, Harry. We’ve got a game to win.
What’s with the birds?
Look, I can’t help it if she’s got her knickers in a twist. What Lav and I have -- well, let’s just say there was no stopping it. It’s chemical. Will it last? Who knows? Point is, I’m a free agent.
Unbreakable Vow. You’re sure that’s what Snape said.
It’s just, well, you can’t break an Unbreakable Vow.
No, you don’t understand -- Oh, bloody hell...
All she wants to do is snog me. My lips are getting chapped. Look.
You die.
Lav, c’mon. Of course I’ll wear it.

It’s beautiful, isn’t it? The moon.
It was on your bed. The box. Thought I’d try one...
I can’t stop thinking about her, Harry.
She could never annoy me. I think... I think I love her.
Do you think she knows I exist?
Snogging? Who’re you talking about?
Romilda, of course. Romilda Vane.

It’s no joke! I’m in love with her!
No. Can you introduce me?

How do I look?
Where’s Romilda?

Hello, darling. Fancy a drink?
What’s this?
What happened to me?
I feel really... bad.
These girls are gonna kill me, Harry.

Er... My... Nee... Er! My! Nee!
Huh?
Tell me again how I broke up withLavender?
Don’t get me wrong. I’m bloody thrilled to be shot of her. It’s just she seems... a bit put out.
Well... there is... something.
But no. It can’t be. Besides, I was completely boggled, wasn’t I?
So. Did you and Ginny do it?
You know. Hide the book.
Still no luck with Slughorn, I take it?
No.
No. I got an owl from Dad this morning. The one at Borgin & Burke’s? It’s still there.
Good luck, mate.

Bloody hell.
Don't know. Hey Dad! Where are we going?
Blimey Dad, how far up ARE we?
There's no one like Krum. He's like a bird the way he rides the wind. He's more than an athlete, he's an artist.
Been looking for you for ages. Thought we lost you.
Packet of drewbals and a liquorice wand.
On second thought, just the drewbals.
Just the drewbals, thanks.
Loads according to Dad, that's what worried them so much. Happened right under their noses.
Blimey it's him, Viktor Krum!
Bloody hell, it's Mad-Eye Moody.
He was a catcher. Half the cells in Azkaban are full thanks to him. He's supposed to be mad as a hatter though these days.
Yes...
Well, my dad did tell me about one... The imperious curse.
Brilliant isn't he! Completely demented of course. Terrifying to be in the same room with, he's really BEEN there you know.
Eternal glory, be brilliant wouldn't it? In three years from now we'll be old enough to be choosen.
How did you do it?
Never mind. Doesn't matter. You could have let your best friend know though.
You know bloody well what.
Yeah that's me, Ron Weasley... Harry Potter's stupid friend.
Piss off.
Who you talking to?
I heard voices.
You're probably just practicing for your next interview I expect.
You think so?
Anything else?
Fine.
I reckon you'd have to be barking mad to put your own name in the goblet of fire.
Wasn't just me who thought you'd done it. Everyone was saying it behind your back.
At least I warned you about the dragons.
Oh no no, I did. Don't you remember? I told Hermione to tell you that Seamus told me that Parvati told Dean that Hagrid was looking for you. Seamus never actually told me anything, so it was really me all along. I thought you'd be alright, you know, after you figured that out.
Yeah it is isn't it. Suppose I was a bit distraught.
Thank you Nigel.
Not now Nigel. Later. Go on.
I told him I'd get him Harry's autograph. Oh look mum's sent me something. Mum sent me a dress??
Ginny these must be for you.
What are you on about?
Dress robes? for what?

Something's about to burst out of Hilary but I don't think it's a swan.
Where?
Blimey Harry, you slayed dragons. If you can't get a date who can?
This is mad. At this rate we'll be the only ones in our year without dates.
Well, us and Neville!
Now I'm really depressed.
Well Hermione, you're a girl.
Come on. It's one thing for a bloke to show up alone. For a girl it's just sad.
Bloody hell.
Look. We've just got to grit our teeth and do it. Tonight when we get back to the common room, we'll both have partners. Agreed?
There she was walking by. You know I like it when they walk. I couldn't help it, it just sort of slipped out.
What else? I ran for it. I'm not cut out for this Harry. I don't know what got into me.
Bloody hell.
What are those??
Well they're alright. No lace, no dodgy little collar.
Traditional?? They're ancient! I look like my great aunt Tessie.
I smell like my great aunt Tessie. Murder me Harry.
Poor kid, bet she's alone in her room crying her eyes out.
Hermione of course. Come on Harry, why'd you think she wouldn't tell us who she's coming with?
Because nobody asked her. I would have taken her myself if she weren't so bleeding proud.
No. Absolutely not.
No, we'd NOT care to join you and Viktor.
He's a Durmstrang. You're fraternising with the enemy.
Hrmph, I think he's got a bit more than friendship on his mind.
No.

He's using you.
Doubt it. He's way too old.
Yeah that is what I think.
Go on.
Well that's completely off the point. Harry...
They get scary when they get older.
Well... yeah... a bit
Merci.
Blimey even when you go wrong it turns out right.
We're still misfits.
Do you think we'll ever just have a quiet year at Hogwarts?
Well I won't. You know I won't!
Hiya, Harry.
Rescuing you, of course. Where's your trunk?
Stand back.
Hold on, Harry!
Put your foot down, Fred!

By the way, Harry. Happy Birthday.

It's not much.
They were starving him, Mum! There were bars on his window!
Ginny. Been talking about you all summer. Dead annoying, really.
Dad works at the Ministry of Magic. In the Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office.
That's when wizards bewitch something to drive Muggles mad. Shrinking door keys, that kind of thing. Dad loves Muggles. Thinks they're fascinating.

Harry, sir. Harry Potter.
Diagon Alley!
Harry's never traveled by Floo Powder before, Mum.
And mind you get out at the right grate!
Mum fancies him.


We better hurry.

I dunno. The gateway's sealed itself for some reason.

Can't hear a thing.
Harry. If we can't get through, maybe Mum and Dad can't get back.
The car!
Who says we're driving?
Look, who knows when Mum and Dad will get back. And we've got to get to school, haven't we? And even underage wizards are allowed to use magic if it's an absolute emergency. Least that's what Fred and George always say...
No problem.

There. See. Now I reckon all we have to do is find the Hogwarts Express and follow it. Simple.

Right.

Uh oh. The Invisibility Booster must be faulty.

Any sign of the train?
Brilliant.

It must be around here someplace.

Aaaahhhhh!

Take my hand!

Hold on!
Welcome home, Harry.

Well... no. but, until a few hours ago, I'd never taken off in one either.

Uh oh.

IT'S NOT WORKING!
STOP! STOP! STOP!

My wand! Look at my wand!
What's happening?

Aaaaahhhhh!

What kind of tree is this?

Aaaaahhhhh!


Dad's going to kill me.

Honestly, Professor Snape, I think it did more damage to us.

We'll go and get our stuff.
Well, you're going to expel us, aren't you?
I should think you'd mind your own business.

Say it. I'm doomed.
Imagine that.
Bloody bird's a menace -- Oh... no.
Look at these questions. They're all about him.
'What is Gilderoy Lockhart's greatest achievement to date?'
What do we do now?
Can you believe him?
He says he's done.
Uh-oh. I smell trouble.
Those are Nimbus Two Thousand Ones.
You'll pay for that one, Malfoy!
Eat slugs!


It's disgusting!
Hear what?
Harry, what are you doing?

What's that? Hanging underneath?

I... don't... like... spiders.

A Squib's someone who's born into a wizarding family but hasn't got any powers of their own. It's why Filch is trying to learn magic from a Kwikspell course. It's also why he hates students so much. He's bitter.

Maybe he was lying.
Are you mad!
Three glasses who?
D'you think it's true? D'you think there really is a Chamber of Secrets?

Let's think. Who do we know who thinks Muggle-borns are scum.
Of course! You heard him: 'You'll be next, Mudbloods'!
Crabbe and Goyle must know. Maybe we could trick them into telling...
When do we start?
You mean, Harry and I drink some of this stuff and we turn into Crabbe and Goyle?
Wicked! Malfoy'll tell us anything!
Hang on now. I'm drinking nothing with Crabbe's toenails in it.
Rogue Bludger?
Of course! Don't you see? Lucius Malfoy must've opened it when he was at school here, and now he's told Draco how to do it.
Enlighten me. Why are we brewing this potion in broad daylight, in the middle of a girls' lavatory? Don't you think we'll get caught?
Why?
Who's Moaning Myrtle?

What's the fun in that?

Who cares?

Come on. Move. Now.
You're a Parselmouth! Why didn't you tell us?
Oh, that's what you said to it.
I heard you speaking Parseltongue. Snake language.
Exactly. And now the whole school's going to think you're his great-great-great grandson or something.
Oh, c'mon, Harry. Fred's just having a laugh.
Okay, so half the school thinks you're nipping off to the Chamber of Secrets every night. Who cares?
Why would that make anyone feel better?
How?

And whose hair are you ripping out?
Have you ever heard of a plan where so many things could go wrong?
Now what?
Ugh. Essence of Crabbe...

Think I'm gonna be sick...

Harry?
Bloody hell.

Bloody hell.

Bloody hell.

Bloody hell.
Hey... Where's Hermione?
Don't swing your arms like that. Crabbe holds them sort of stiff.

Yeah. That's better.
What are you doing here?

What are you doing here?

Stomachache.
Ho!

That was close!
Look at your tail.
Madam Pince asked that we relay a message to you, Hermione: She'd appreciate it if you'd leave a few books for the rest of the school.
Is that thing ever going away?
We all are, believe me.
'To Miss Granger. Wishing you a speedy recovery, from your concerned teacher Gilderoy Lockhart.' You sleep with this under your pillow?
I know Hermione's mental, but can you believe she falls for that smarmy nonsense of Lockhart's?

Yuck.
But it can't hurt if someone throws something at you. I mean, it'd just go right through you, wouldn't it?
Fifty points if you can get it through her nose.
It's a diary, it's old... and was most recently in a toilet, Harry.

Are you mad? That could be cursed. Dad once told me about a book the Ministry confiscated that burned the eyes out of anyone who tried to read it.
Who doesn't?

Tom Marvolo Riddle? Hang on. I know that name...
Of course! The night I had detention... My job was to polish the silver in the trophy room. I remember because I kept burping slugs all over Tom Riddle's trophy. I must have wiped slime off his name for an hour.

What? What's happened...?
We don't even know this Riddle. He sounds like a dirty, rotten snitch to me.
That'd be a cheerful visit. Hullo, Hagrid. Tell us, have you been setting anything mad and hairy loose in the castle lately?
No!

Well, whoever it was, they were looking for something.
Hey, Ginny! Going to the match?

I tell you, she gets weirder and weirder by the day...
No... don't tell me...

That's Hermione. When in doubt, go to the library
Hermione!
But you heard McGonagall. We're not allowed to leave the tower except for class --

That's Dad's boss! Cornelius Fudge. The Minister of Magic!

Hagrid's right. With Dumbledore gone, there'll be an attack a day.
What are you doing?
They're heading into the Dark Forest.

Why spiders. Why couldn't it be 'Follow the butterflies'?
Harry!... Harry, it's our car!

I don't have a good feeling about this, Harry --
Harry...
Can we panic now?

Nice knowing you.


I CAN'T! IT'S STUCK!

Thanks for that.

Flying gear's jammed!

'Follow the spiders'! Follow the spiders'! If he ever gets out of Azkaban, I'll kill Hagrid. I mean, what was the point of sending us in there? What have we found out?
We know that, Madam Pomfrey. It's just, well, you see, we thought, maybe, we could... be with her for a bit. She's our... friend, you see, and... even if she can't hear us... I mean, it can't hurt, can it?

You don't think Lockhart could be the heir of Slytherin, do you?
Right. Forget I said it.

But it kills by looking people in the eye. Why is it no one's dead?

And Mrs. Norris? I'm pretty sure she didn't have a camera or a mirror, Harry.
But how's the Basilisk been getting around? A dirty great snake. Someone would have seen...

Pipes...? It's using the plumbing.
Moaning Myrtle!

She knew something, Harry. She'd found out something about the Chamber of Secrets. That's why she was taken. I mean, she was -- is -- a pure-blood. There can't be any other reason.
Harry. D'you think there's any chance at all she's not, you know --

What about my sister?
You're the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher! You can't go now!
Is there anything you can do?
Say something, Harry. Say something in Parseltongue.

English.

A bloody lot of good if it's a two-hundred-foot drop onto jagged rocks.

What's that? Up ahead?
Bloody hell. Whatever shed this must be twenty feet long. Or more.

Heart of a lion, this one.

I'm okay. This git's not, though. He got blasted by my wand.

What now?
I'll try and shift some of this rock. So you can get back through. And, Harry --
Ginny!

You're alive. I can't believe it.

Remind you of anyone?
His Memory Charm backfired. Hasn't got a clue who he is. I keep having to stop him wandering off. He's a danger to himself.
No.

What's with the bird?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.

Thank you, sir.
Welcome back, Hermione.

Let him breathe, Hermione!
HERMIONE!
Good to see you, mate.
We wanted to, mate, we really did, but he thought they would get intercepted.
He thought you would be safest there.
We've only seen him twice, and not for very long. He's really busy.
It's not that fun, mate. Mum won't let us anywhere near the meetings.
We've already told you, we're not privyed to the meetings. But we do know a few things.
What does he get a hug for?
Oh, sure, that's why.
Me? Jealous? Of course not, it just doesn't seem fair that you hug one friend more than the other, is all...
No, I'd hate to force you... Harry grins and shakes his head.

I knew it!
Come on, lets go back downstairs!

What?
Harry, there's nothing there, mate...
What if he were still on his...
...what if he's still on his mission from Dumbledore?
You reckon she's here to spy on us?
Well, Harry, shall we start on Snape's report?
Harry! I tried out for Quidditch Keeper at the tryouts! I'm on the team!
Harry--bloody hell!
You said she was making you do lines! They settle Harry back down.
Always knew she was a bit fishy.
Anything about Harry?
Wait, he's one of the Order! Hermione glares at Ron.
Do you s'pose it was a frameup? They stop talking. Dean Thomas walks by.
Right.
No, he's right. I'm useless out there. Complete rubbish.
I'm gonna make a fool of myself out there. Harry gasps and rubs at his scar.
Yeah, well, poison should do the trick.

Hermes?
It's from Percy!
"Dear Ron, congratulations on becoming a Prefect. For some time I was worried you would take the 'Fred and George' route instead of following in my footsteps.

You can imagine my relief that this is not the case." He looks incredulously at Harry and Hermione.
"Given your attachment to using me as a role model, I will give you a bit of advice from one respecter of authority to another.
It is likely that you have been seeing quite a lot of Harry Potter of late. I must recommend you break ties with that boy as soon as possible. He may be Dumbledore's favorite, but Dumbledore may not be in charge at Hogwarts much longer. Your loyalties should lie with the Ministry of Magic, not Dumbledore and Potter's personality cult.
Please do not fear breaking ties with Potter. If trouble arrises, go to Dolores Umbridge, a truly delightful woman.
I hope you will carefully consider my advice to you, Ron. Don't let the dangerous errors of Dumbledore, Potter, and unfortunately our parents lure you into destroying a perfectly good career. Percy." Ron looks up, aghast.
He is the world's biggest git! He hurls the pieces into the fireplace.
Yeah, full of the usual rubbish.
But if he was supposed to be back by now...
"Ministry Passes Educational Decree Number Twenty-Three: Dolores Umbridge Appointed Hogwarts High Inquisitor"? He looks at Harry and Hermione.
What's that mean?
Why's that?
"The Hog's Head," Hermione? She leads them towards it.
Not to mention you dueled with You- Know-Who all alone and he still couldn't kill you!
She can't!
Or somebody at the meeting could have blabbed to her.
She doesn't look very good.
I'm going to resign. Harry is slumped low in a chair.
I'm horrible! I should never have joined.
This is the worst day of my life. Hermione is staring out of the window.
Hermione, give it up.
Come off it, Hagrid! We're not blind!
A month?
You went into caves looking for giants?
So...no giants are coming?
Lockhart didn't teach as much as prune himself.
Get McGonagall! Go! Neville turns and runs out of the dorms.
Harry! HARRY!
Yeah, sorry about that, mate. Lockhart peers at him.
Yeah, it was my wand that backfired on you.
Hey, Neville! Neville turns beet-red, and looks away. His GRANDMOTHER looks at the three of them.
Who're you visiting, Neville? Mrs. Longbottom turns to Neville.
So you're saying this weapon You- Know-Who's after is in the Department of Mysteries?
But why the Department of Mysteries?
Bloody hell!
No way. Quidditch practice. If I don't show up, Angelina'll go mad. They part ways.
Oy! That's Umbridge down there!
Look! Harry smiles.
McGonagall'll sort this out!
You all right?
To the Department of Mysteries?
Yeah. They can't just waltz into the Ministry of Magic!
Shut up, Malfoy!
Stupify!
That's just what we were wondering.
So, how do we get to the Ministry?
What are what? He looks right at them and doesn't see them.
And what about those of us who can't see them? Luna comes over to them.
Never again...
What do you mean, people?
Harry, have you seen this? Harry looks over his shoulder.
Er...it's got your name on it. Sure enough, there was a golden orb resting on the shelf with the label "S.P.T. to A.P.W.B.D.: The Dark Lord and
Harry Potter."
Hiyya, Harry.
You look funny.... He laughs again.
Good as new, mate.
I'm warning you, Hermione! Keep that bloody beast of yours away from Scabbers or I'll turn it into a tea cozy.
A cat! Is that what they told you? Looks more like a pig with hair if you ask me.
Harry.
Brilliant. It's got loads of old stuff. Mummies. Death masks. Tombs -
I also got a new wand.
I haven't shown anyone!
Brilliant!
I still think it was brilliant. SNAP! SNAP! SNAP! A copy of the The Monster Book of Monsters SCUTTLES CRAB-LIKE down the aisle, pursued by NEVILLE LONGBOTTOM. Hi, Harry.
Hi, Neville.

Who d'you reckon he is?
You know everything. How is it she knows everything?
Let me get this straight. Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban to come after you? Yes.
Sure -- Of course, no one's ever broken out of Azkaban before and he's a raving, murderous lunatic... Just then, the COMPARTMENT RATTLES. Lanterns flicker. The train LURCHES, begins to SLOW. Hermione slides down the seat, pinning Ron against the window. They exchange an awkward glance, then Hermione carefully slides to the other end of the seat and glances at her WATCH. Frowns.
What's going on?
There's something moving out there. I think... people are coming aboard.
Bloody hell. What's happening?
Well, you sort of went... rigid. We thought maybe you were having a fit or something.
No. I felt... weird. Like I'd never be cheerful again. But... no.
Good to be home, eh, Harry?
Where'd you come from?
Well. He's got a wonky sort of cross -- that's trials and suffering. But this lot here could be the sun -- that's great happiness. So... he's going to suffer but be very happy about it.
Ancient Runes? Exactly how many classes are you taking this term? A fair few.
Hang on. Ancient Runes is the same time as Divination. You'd have to be in two classes at once.
Hagrid. Exactly what is that?
The little git. He's really laying it on thick, isn't he?
Who?
When'd she get here?
Riddikulus!
And Honeyduke's is brilliant! Sugar Quills, Flaming Whizbees -and blood-flavored lollipops for Halloween!
Huh? Oh. Yeah. Dead depressing. Hang on. I almost forgot. I got you something wicked at Dervish and Banges. It's a Pocket Sneakoscope.
If there's someone untrustworthy around, it's meant to light up and spin. Mind you, Fred and George say it's rubbish, sold for wizard tourists, but I thought, you know, it can't hurt, given that...
Oh, careful of those, they'll make your...
Never mind.
What's the hold-up? Only Neville ever forgets the password.
Probably stuffing her face with the apples in that still life on the second floor again.
Yeah, we'll call you... if we ever need someone mental.
Werewolves?

When did she come in? Did you see her come in...

He's got a point, you know.
Looks a bit peaky, doesn't he?
You fell off your broom.
There's something else you should know, Harry. Your Nimbus -- when it blew away? -- it sort of landed in the Whomping Willow. And well...

Oh... All right...
Actually, it's fine from here.
Shut your mouth, Malfoy.
Bloody hell, Harry! That was not funny!
Those weasels! Never told me about any Marauder's Map!
Oh sure. Along with his invisibility cloak, his pack of exploding snap cards, his -
It's not true!
Harry?
Aaaahhhh!
Is he gone?
I don't know how he got in! I was a bit busy dodging his knife!
And this bloody cat ate my rat!
It is not and you bloody well know it!
I find it astonishing that someone who prides herself on being so logical can be in such denial.
Harry was there! He'll tell you how it was. Go on, Harry, tell her.
Really? Wasn't you had to roll under the bed last night to avoid getting cut to ribbons! A person could die being your friend, Harry!
Draco. It's him the Committee should punish. It's him they should send off to the forest, not Buckbeak.
She's gone mental, Hermione has. I mean, not that she wasn't always mental, but now it's out in the open for everyone to see...
Hermione! No!
He's not worth it.
What!
I'm not kissing Fang if that's what you're thinking...
Scabbers! You're alive!
Right. Next time I see Crookshanks, I'll let him know.
He bit me...
Now behave yourself.
Harry! Run!
Aaaahhh!
Harry!
It's a trap, Harry. He's the dog. He's an Animagus...
Professor Lupin!

You're mad...
M-me? It's lunatic...
Scabbers? Scabbers has been in my family for -
So what?
What are you going to do to him?
It's Scabbers who did it!
My rat, sir. Only he's not really a rat. Well, he was a rat. You see, he used to be my brother Percy's -
What in bloody hell was all that about?
How'd you two get over there? I was just talking to you... over there.
Stand back, I said! I'll take it upstairs if you don't settle!
Quiet!
Thank you. Let the man through.

Whose is it? It's yours, mate.
Mind? Everywhere else is full.
I'm Ron, by the way.
I... heard.
Is it true? I mean, have you really got the... you know...
Wicked.
Huh? Oh. I think so. Well, Mum's got a second cousin who's an accountant. But we never talk about him. I heard you went to live with Mugg1es. What are they like?
Five. I'm the sixth in our family to go to Hogwarts. Everyone expects me to do as well as the others. But if I do, it's no big deal because they did it first. You never get anything new, either, with five brothers. I've got Bill's old robes. Charlie's old wand. Even Scabbers used to be Percy's...
Hardly ever wakes up. He's useless basically. Percy got an owl for making Prefect, but Mum and Dad couldn't afford-- I mean, I got Scabbers instead.
They mean every flavor. There's chocolate, peppermint... but you can also get liver or spinach or tripe. George reckons he had a bogey-flavored one once.

Just a spell. Besides, it's the card you want. Each pack's got a Famous Witch or Wizard. Got about 500 myself. Watch it!
That's rotten luck. They've only got one good jump in them to begin with.

I've about six of him. Trade you Scabbers though, if you get Agrippa or Ptolemy.
Thought he'd be older, did you?
Well, you can't expect him to hang around all day, can you?
Really? They don't move at all? Weird!
Pathetic, isn't it? Fred gave me a spell that's to turn him yellow. Want to see?
Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow, Turn this stupid. fat rat yellow.
Um... Ron Weasley.
Some kind of test, I think. Fred says it hurts like hell, but I'm sure he was joking. At least... I think he was.

Mental, that one. I'm telling you.
Slytherin.

There's not a witch or wizard who went bad who wasn't in Slytherin. Draco's father was one of the first to join You-Know-Who when he got power. And one of the first to come back when he lost it.
Harry? What is it?
I know you. You're Nearly Headless Nick.
This is Staircase Twelve North, which should take us to Backward Staircase Seven--no wait a minute, we're on Backward Staircase Seven...
I hate her.
Whew! We made it, mate. Can you imagine old McGonagall's face if we were late first day out...
That was bloody brilliant!
Turn it to rum. Actually managed a weak tea yesterday before it...
Two Knuts says he loses his eyebrows by week's end. Ah, mail's here.
Hey look! Neville's gotten a Remembrall!

It's mad. Dad says there are dragons guarding some of the vaults.
Seeker! But first years never make the House teams. You must be the youngest Quidditch player in-
Fred and George are on the team too. Beaters.
Oh go on, Harry. Quidditch is great. Best game there is. And you'll be great too.
Harry ... you didn't tell me your father was a Seeker too.
I'm telling you, it's spooky. She knows more about you than you do.
Does anybody feel like ... we shouldn't be here?
That's it. We' re done for.
Chapter Seven?
He probably thinks this door is locked.
What do they think they're doing keeping a thing like that locked up in school?
I wasn't looking at its feet. I was a bit preoccupied with its heads. Or maybe you didn't notice. There were three.
WINGARDIUM LEVIOSA!
You do it then, if you're so clever.
It's Levi-ohhhhh-sa. Not Levi-o-saaaah. She's a nightmare, honestly. No wonder she hasn't got any friends.
Not on its own. Trolls are really stupid. Probably Peeves' playing jokes...
What?
Smells like Fred's socks. Only... worse.
Yes!
Don't worry, Hermione! We're here!
She's dead.
What do we do?
Confuse it?
Hey, pea brain!
Wingardium Leviosa.
Wingardium LEVI-OHHHH-SA!
No need to kill it, after all.
Mind you, we did save her from a full grown mountain troll.
What are friends for?
Take a bit of toast, mate. Go on.
I tell you what's disturbing. Snape smiling.
But what's safer than Gringotts?
That's not a broomstick, Harry. That's a Nimbus Two Thousand.
He hasn't had much to do yet.
FOUL! FOUL! FOUL!
Maybe something happened to it when Flint blocked him.
Jinxing the broom? What do we do?
Come on, Hermione...
Fluffy?
Queen to pawn six.
That's chess. I see you're packed.
Change of plans. My parents decided to go to Romania to visit my brother Charlie. He's studying dragons there.
We have looked. A hundred times.
Happy Christmas, Harry!
What'd you expect? In your hand's from Hagrid. And by the looks of that lumpy one, Mum's sent you a Weasley sweater.
Well let's see then. Put it on.
Ahhh!
Harry, do you know what this is? It's an invisibility cloak. They're really rare. Who gave you this?

That's you, Harry.
Me. Only I'm... Head Boy! And I'm holding the Quidditch Cup and... bloody hell... I'm Quidditch Captain too! Harry, do you think this mirror shows the future?
Want to play chess?
Want to go visit Hagrid?
Harry, I know what you're thinking. But don't. There's something not right about that mirror.
And I'll tell you again. I forgot.
Crib off you.
That's insulting. It's as if they don't trust us.
Dumbledore again.
Leg-Locker Curse.
Malfoy.
You've got to start standing up to him, Neville.
All right then, Neville, who shall it be? Me, Hermione, or...
He's bowling. So what? He's always bowling.
Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald, for the discovery ofthe twelve uses of dragon's blood... and his work on alchemy... with his partner, Nicolas Flamel.
This is light?
The what?
Immortal.
I know what it means--
So Snape wants piles of gold and to live forever. Who wouldn't?
I know what that is! But Hagrid. How did you ever get one?
That's not just a dragon! That's a Norwegian Ridgeback! My brother Charlie works with these in Romania
But it's crazy. And worse, Malfoy knows.
It's bad.
Norwegian Ridgeback.
I just meant... in this case... sorry.
Why bother? Even with Malfoy losing points, Slytherin's a lock for the House Cup. And look. Malfoy knows it.
A baby that breaths fire.
You mean... You-Know-Who's out there, right now, in the forest!
But if he comes back, you don't think he'd try to... kill you? Do you?
And to think I've been worrying about my Potions final.
I'm stunned my head didn't explode. Alright there, Harry?
Trevor! Shh! Go! You shouldn't be here!
To people. Not us.
You're a little scary sometimes, you know that? Brilliant. But scary.
Sorry. I get hungry when I'm nervous.
Wait a minute. He's...
Don't be stupid.
Yuck! What's this ruddy stuff--
That was...cool.
Lucky this plant thing's here, really.
Wo!
Kill us faster? Oh now I can relax. As they watch, Hermione takes a LONG, SLOW BREATH and... is SUCKED beneath the surface... VANISHING.
Hermione!
What are we going to do now!
Is she doing a poem? It's not possible she's doing a poem, is it?
Lucky we didn't panic.
Alohomora!
Well, it was worth a try.

We're looking for a big, old-fashioned one--probably silver, like the handle. There! That one, see! With the bright blue wings!
The feather's pinched. Probably from Snape catching it before us.
Oh, go on, Harry. If Snape could catch it on that old CleanSweep, you can. It's not for nothing you're the youngest Seeker in a Century.
Well,this complicates things a bit.
He'll be torn to pieces.

This is no graveyard...
It's a chessboard.

It's obvious, isn't it? We've got to play our way across the room. Excuse me... are we meant to join you?
Brilliant.
Now don't be offended, but neither of you are particularly good at chess-
All right. Harry, you take the empty Bishop's square. Hermione--you'll be the Queenside castle. As for me...
...I'll be a Knight.
We play.
You there... d5
Yes, Hemione. I think this is going to be exactly like wizard's chess.
Think...Think...
Castle to... c3
There's just one problem with that. It's you that has to go on, Harry. I know it. Not me. Not Hermione. You.
Do you want to stop Snape from getting the Stone or not!
You understand, right, Harry? Once I make my move, the Queen will take me. Then you're free to check the King.
All right. You?
D'you think Dumbledore meant for it all to happen'? And for you to do it'? Sending you your father's cloak and all?
Of course! And now that he's squared things, he can hate Harry in peace, right, Professor?
I think she's warming up to me.
You'd think saving the bloody school from a Dark Lord would count for something.
Come on now, Harry.
Harry.
Snape knows. He knows that Harry was spotted in Hogsmeade.
Ready!?
What?
Mad. The both of you.
I know.
It’s all right. We’re going to get you inside.
Don’t worry. I won’t leave you. I promise.
Who’s that? Neville turns, sees that Ginny has come out onto the broken steps and is staring at the procession.
... Hagrid’s carrying?
Neville, who is that?
No... NO!
Ron and Tonks should’ve already been back. Dad and Fred as well.
Oh my God! George!
Remus! What’re you doing!

Were you going to tell me?
And Ron and Hermione. They’ll not be going back to Hogwarts either?
I see.
Zip me up, will you.
Seems silly, doesn’t it? A wedding. Given everything that’s going on.
Hedwig...? Mum!
Exactly. How’d you guess?

I’m joking, Mum.
Now you’re joking. I was only wondering when Harry got here.
Harry Dimpleton. Harry Potter, of course.
Well his trunk’s in the kitchen. And his owl.
Me, nosy. Is he up there with you?
Harry’s. Haven’t seen him, have you? Apparently, he’s wandering about the house.
Meaning?
None of your business.
Please. What’s a Wrackspurt?
He’s covered in blood again. Why is it he’s always covered in blood?
SHUT IT!
Piss off, Cormac. How ‘bout I toss you a floater?
Who’s the Half-Blood Prince?
That’s what it says. Right here. ‘This Book is the Property of theHalf-Blood Prince.’

Sorry, I’m not ordinarily late --
What’s gotten into him?
Open up, you.
Don’t trust me?
‘Course ‘tis. Made them myself.
Everyone gone to bed?
I don’t sleep these days. So I wash my hair. Silly, right?

Happy Christmas, Harry.
Harry turns, his BREATH FOGGING the WINDOWPANE as, far below, FLAMES SNAKE out of the reeds and SLITHER toward the house. Bellatrix emerges, peering up through the darkness toward Harry’s SILHOUETTE, a mad grin on her face. As she SHRIEKS EERILY, his eyes flash with hatred.
No, Harry! It’s a trap!
‘Bout time, don’t you think?
You have to get rid of it. Today.
Take my hand.
Over the years, if someone had a secret, if they wanted to conceal something, this is where they came. Some of these things are almost as old as the castle itself.
Fred and George. First year. I hid Tom Riddle’s diary here for a time. Wish I’d left it...

What was that?
See, you never know what you’ll find up here.

All right. Close your eyes. That way you can’t be tempted.

There’s something else. Another secret of sorts. One of mine...

That can stay hidden up here too, if you like.

Think you're in love Ron?
I'm not wearing that it's ghastly.
Mummy. Have you seen my jumper --

Leave him alone! He didn't want all that!
Harry. It was me! But I swear, I didn't mean to... Riddle made me. He wrote to me... took me over... I didn't even know whose diary it was. I found it inside my cauldron. The day we all went to Diagon Alley and... Harry. You're hurt...
I'm going to be expelled, I just know it!
I didn't know whose diary it was, sir. I swear. I found it inside my cauldron.
The day we all went to Diagon Alley.

But I understand if... given all the trouble I've caused... if you --
FRED, GEORGE, AND GINNY
He got off, he got off, he got off! Hermione hugs Harry again. Ron glowers at her.
Someone here does.
Well, he's only confronted You-Know- Who himself four times and lived to talk about it.
And you fought off those dementors that attacked you this summer. Hermione looks tremendously pleased.
I think it should be Dumbledore's Army. There is excited agreement. Harry smiles at her.
Harry, what's happening--
We've got to go to St. Mungo's.
Mum!
No.
Did you forget that I've been possessed by You-Know-Who before?

Lucky you. Anyway, that's what I wanted to talk to you about.
Can you remember everything you've done this year? There aren't any blank spots in your memory?
Then You-Know-Who has never possessed you, Harry. She sits down on the bed next to him.
I don't know what's going on with you right now, but possession's not one of them. You're not dangerous.

Don't mention it.

We heard Harry yelling. What's up?
Anything we can do to help?
We can do that! Me and Luna'll guard the hallway. Harry smiles at them.
What now, Harry?
The Ministry closed a half-hour ago. I expect they all went home. Harry nods grimly.
Now where?
I think my ankle's broken. And somebody hit Ron with a weird spell... Ron laughs strangely.
That's your nose, Fred.
The Fat Lady... she's gone.
No. You don't understand -
Oh, Mum, can I go on and see him? Please.
