  <scene>
   <stage>FADE IN: </stage>
   <stage cat="EXT" where=" NUMBER FOUR PRIVET DRIVE - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT "> The street slumbers,
    adrift in shadow. Then... a curious BEAM OF LIGHT BOBS beyond the second-story window of Number
    Four. </stage>
  </scene>
  <scene>
   <stage cat="INT" where=" HARRY'S ROOM - SAME TIME - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT "> A tent of blankets.
    Within... the SHADOW of a BOY. A WHISPER: </stage>
   <sp who="#HARRY"> Lumos Maxima... <stage> The tent BLOOMS SOFTLY with light -- briefly
     illuminating a bedside PHOTOGRAPH (of James &amp; Lily Potter) -- then goes dark. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY"> Lumos Maxima... <stage> The blankets bloom once again when, down the hall, a
     TOILET FLUSHES. Instantly, the SHADOW stiffens, the blankets DIM, and the tent flattens. Just
     as... ... the bedroom door OPENS, revealing... UNCLE VERNON. He peers inside, eyes flashing
     suspiciously, then... withdraws. The tent rises. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY"> Lumos Maxima... <stage> As the blankets blaze, we CUT INSIDE, find a SKINNY BOY
     with a crow's nest of black hair, thick glasses sitting crookedly atop his nose: HARRY POTTER.
     Open before him is Violeta Stitch's Extreme Incantations. Once again, he speaks: </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY"> Lumos... MAXIMA! </sp>
  </scene>
  <scene>
   <stage cat="EXT" where=" NUMBER FOUR PRIVET DRIVE - SAME TIME - NIGHT "> A BLINDING BLAST OF
    LIGHT FLASHES from the second story window of Number Four. DOGS BARK. And a TITLE CARD appears:
    HARRY POTTER and the Prisoner of Azkaban </stage>
  </scene>
  <scene>
   <stage cat="INT" where=" HARRY'S ROOM - SAME TIME - NIGHT "> The light in the hallway SNAPS on,
    Harry's tent droops once more and, seconds later, Harry's door eases open. Uncle Vernon peers in
    and switches on the light. The room is utterly SILENT. Slowly, he closes the door. </stage>
  </scene>
  <scene>
   <stage cat="INT" where=" FOUR PRIVET DRIVE - STAIRWAY/FRONT HALL - DAY "> The DOORBELL CHIMES and
    a shrill VOICE THUNDERS: Harry! </stage>
   <sp who="#AUNTPETUNIA "><stage>O.S.</stage> Harry! Harry bounds down the stairs and into the
    front hall, where his AUNT PETUNIA and cousin DUDLEY stand stiffly. Petunia flicks a bit of
    fluff from Dudley's sweater, glowers crossly at Harry, and jerks her head toward the door. Well,
    go on. </sp>
   <sp who="#AUNTPETUNIA "> Open it. Harry reaches for the knob when -- BLAM! -- it BURSTS OPEN,
    revealing a LARGE, WADDLING WOMAN (AUNT MARGE) and a LARGE WADDLING BULLDOG (RIPPER). Uncle
    Vernon lurches forward out of the teeming RAIN, an ENORMOUS SUITCASE in hand, and drops it on
    Harry. <stage> </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#AUNTPETUNIA "> Marge! Welcome! How was the train? </sp>
   <sp who="#AUNTMARGE "> Wretched. Ripper got sick. </sp>
   <sp who="#AUNTPETUNIA "> Ah. How... unfortunate. </sp>
   <sp who="#AUNTMARGE "> I would've left him with the others, but he pines so when I'm away. Don't
    you, darling? Aunt Marge puckers her lips at Ripper and leads him down the hallway. Harry
    follows with Uncle Vernon. </sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY"> Uncle Vernon. I need you to sign this form. </sp>
   <sp who="#UNCLEVERNON "> What is it? </sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY"> Nothing. Something for school... <stage> Uncle Vernon eyes the PARCHMENT in
     Harry's hand suspiciously. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#UNCLEVERNON "> Later perhaps. If you behave. </sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY"> I will if she does. </sp>
   <sp who="#AUNTMARGE ">
    <stage>(turning, eyeing Harry) </stage> So. Still here, are you? </sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY"> Yes. </sp>
   <sp who="#AUNTMARGE "> Don’t say 'yes' in that ungrateful tone. Damn good of my brother to keep
    you, if you ask me. <stage>(to Vernon, Petunia)</stage> It'd have been straight to an orphanage
    if he'd been dumped on my doorstep. <stage>Just then Dudley -- sitting comatose before the TV
     -emits a HOLLOW, BRAIN-DEAD CHUCKLE.</stage>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#AUNTMARGE "> Is that my Dudders! Hm? Is that my neffy poo? Come and say hello to your
    Auntie Marge. <stage> Marge flashes a thick FAN of POUND NOTES. Dudley blinks, waddles forward,
     and extends his plump palm obediently. Harry looks on, then sees Ripper snuffling about his
     ankle. </stage></sp>
  </scene>
  <scene>
   <stage cat="INT" where=" FOUR PRIVET DRIVE - DINING ROOM - DUSK "> As Harry clears the dishes,
    Uncle Vernon brings out a bottle of brandy. </stage>
   <sp who="#UNCLEVERNON "> Can I tempt you, Marge? </sp>
   <sp who="#AUNTMARGE "> Just a small one. A bit more... a bit more... That's the boy.
     <stage>(taking a sloppy sip) </stage> Aah. Excellent nosh, Petunia. It's normally just a fry-up
    for me, what with twelve dogs. <stage> She smacks her lips, lowers her brandy, and lets Ripper
     take a slobbery lap out of the glass... then catches Harry looking. </stage>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#AUNTMARGE "> What are you smirking at! Where is it that you send him, Vernon? </sp>
   <sp who="#UNCLEVERNON "> St. Brutus's. It's a first-rate institution for hopeless cases.
     <stage>Hearing this, Harry frowns, glances at Uncle Vernon, who glares darkly at him. </stage>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#AUNTMARGE "> I see. And do they use the cane at St. Brutus's, boy? </sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY">
    <stage>(sarcastically)</stage> Oh, yes. I've been beaten loads of times. </sp>
   <sp who="#AUNTMARGE "> Excellent. I won't have this namby-pamby wishy-washy nonsense about not
    hitting people who deserve it. <stage>(another sip)</stage> Still. Mustn't blame yourself for
    how this one's turned out, Vernon. It all comes down to blood. Bad blood will out. What is it
    the boy's father did, Petunia? </sp>
   <sp who="#AUNTPETUNIA ">
    <stage>(agitated)</stage> Nothing. That is... he didn't work. He was -- unemployed. </sp>
   <sp who="#AUNTMARGE "> Of course. And a drunk, I expect - </sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY"> That's a lie. <stage>Aunt Marge pauses on her wine, eyes narrowing on Harry.
    </stage>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#AUNTMARGE "> What did you say? </sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY"> My dad wasn't a drunk. <stage> POP! The GLASS in Aunt Marge's hand EXPLODES.
    </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#AUNTPETUNIA "> Oh my goodness! Marge! </sp>
   <sp who="#AUNTMARGE "> Not to worry, Petunia. I have a very firm grip. <stage> Harry stares at
     the shattered glass in surprise. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#UNCLEVERNON "> You go to bed. Now. </sp>
   <sp who="#AUNTMARGE "> Quiet, Vernon. It doesn't matter about the father. In the end it comes
    down to the mother. You see it all the time with dogs. If there's something wrong with the
    bitch, there'll be something wrong with the pup... </sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY"> Shut up! Shut up! <stage> Aunt Marge starts to reply, when -- ZING! -- a BUTTON
     on her dress sails into the air. SEAMS GROAN. THREAD SNAPS. Aunt Marge's eyes WIDEN. Her cheeks
     BILLOW. Her whole body BILLOWS. And she begins to INFLATE like a MONSTROUS BALLOON.
    </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#UNCLEVERNON "> MARGE! <stage> As she rises, Uncle Vernon leaps for her. RIPPER GROWLS,
     fixes his teeth to his trousers. Harry frightened by what he's done, watches Aunt Marge BOUNCE
     GENTLY across the ceiling and into the CONSERVATORY. </stage></sp>
  </scene>
  <scene>
   <stage cat="EXT" where=" BACK YARD - CONTINUOUS ACTION - DUSK "> The others race outside. As Aunt
    Marge begins to float away, Uncle Vernon grips her hands. </stage>
   <sp who="#UNCLEVERNON "> Don't worry! I've got you... <stage> Slowly... to his horror... Uncle
     Vernon himself begins to RISE. Aunt Marge looks fearfully into his eyes... </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#AUNTMARGE "> Vernon. Don't you dare -<stage> But he does. He lets go. Falls to his
     knees. And watches Aunt Marge float away. </stage></sp>
  </scene>
  <scene>
   <stage cat="INT" where=" HARRY'S ROOM - DUSK (SECONDS LATER) "> Harry crashes inside, takes his
    TRUNK, then puts his heel to a LOOSE FLOORBOARD and removes his WAND from its hiding place.
    Turning, he grabs the PHOTOGRAPH of his parents. </stage>
  </scene>
  <scene>
   <stage cat="INT" where=" HALLWAY - DUSK (SECONDS LATER) "> BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! Harry tows the TRUNK
    down the stairs... finds Uncle Vernon waiting for him. </stage>
   <sp who="#UNCLEVERNON "> YOU BRING HER BACK! YOU BRING HER BACK AND PUT HER RIGHT! </sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY"> No! She deserved what she got! And you... you keep away from me. <stage> Uncle
     Vernon eyes Harry's wand nervously, then grins with knowing cruelty. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#UNCLEVERNON "> You're not allowed to do magic out of school. They won't have you now.
    You've got nowhere to go. <stage> Harry realizes it's true. Briefly falters. Then: </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY"> Anywhere's better than here. </sp>
  </scene>
  <scene>
   <stage cat="EXT" where=" NUMBER FOUR PRIVET DRIVE - DUSK (SECONDS LATER) "> As Harry storms out
    with his trunk, we DOLLY TO the street WITH him. High in the sky, a plump DOT rises. Aunt Marge.
   </stage>
  </scene>
  <scene>
   <stage cat="EXT" where=" MAGNOLIA CRESCENT - NIGHT (LATER) "> Harry walks and walks and walks,
    then... stops. Glances about. An empty PLAYGROUND. SWINGS CREAKING gently on rusted chains. A
    tiny CAROUSEL, kissed gently by the wind, turning slowly. Harry drops the trunk. Sits. Deep in
    the night, an ALARM SHRIEKS, goes SILENT. Harry, still as a statue. Listening. In the trees
    above, LEAVES TREMBLE. The WIND gathers. Harry turns, studies the swaying swings, the carousel.
    Then, he... stiffens. Turns back. Sensing something in the shadows across the street, he rises.
    Slowly draws his wand. Then he sees... it. Something BIG. Darker than the shadows which conceal
    it. Something with WIDE, GLEAMING EYES. Harry steps back. Afraid to look. Afraid not to. Wand
    outstretched... he TRIPS, tumbles over the forgotten trunk. The tip of his wand BLAZES. BANG!
    TWIN BEAMS of BLINDING LIGHT spear the night. </stage>
   <sp who="#HARRY"> Aaaah! <stage> GIANT WHEELS bear down. Harry rolls clear -- just as a
     PREPOSTEROUSLY PURPLE, TRIPLE-DECKER BUS SCREECHES to a halt. GOLD LETTERS glimmer above the
     windscreen: The Knight Bus. DOORS HISS. Snap back. REVEAL STAN SHUNPIKE, an 18year- old boy in
     a WRINKLED CONDUCTOR'S UNIFORM. Pasty face. Raccoon eyes. Stan looks like he hasn't seen the
     sun in years. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#STANSHUNPIKE ">
    <stage>(wearily, drearily)</stage> Welcome to the Knight Bus. Emergency transport for the
    stranded witch or wizard. My name is Stan Shunpike, and I will be your conductor this evening.
     <stage>(peering at Harry)</stage> Wha' choo doin' down there? </sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY"> Fell over. </sp>
   <sp who="#STANSHUNPIKE "> Wha' choo fall over for? </sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY"> I didn't do it on purpose. <stage> Stan eyes Harry suspiciously, nods slowly.
    </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#STANSHUNPIKE "> Well, come on then. Let's not wait for the grass to grow. <stage> As
     Stan grabs Harry's trunk, Harry peers into the shadows across the street -- now simply shadows
     -- and climbs aboard. </stage></sp>
  </scene>
  <scene>
   <stage cat="INT" where=" THE KNIGHT BUS - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) "> No seats. Only BEDS. The BRASS
    frames need a shine, the lines a wash. In one bed, a DISHEVELED WIZARD GRUNTS, turns over in his
    sleep. </stage>
   <sp who="#DISHEVELEDWIZARD "> Not now... I'm pickling slugs... <stage> Behind the wheel, ERNIE,
     an UNSHAVEN WIZARD in THICK GLASSES, stares straight ahead, armpits stained with sweat. A
     SHRUNKEN HEAD dangles from the rearview mirror, MUTTERING incessantly through the STITCHES that
     lace its mouth. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#STANSHUNPIKE "> Take 'er away, Ern. </sp>
   <sp who="#SHRUNKENHEAD "> Yeah, take it away! <stage> BANG! Ernie rockets away and the beds -- as
     one --slide six inches to the rear. Harry drops onto the bed nearest, peers up at the
     CHANDELIER SWAYING directly above his head. Beyond the windscreen ONCOMING TRAFFIC WHIPS past
     in a blur. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#STANSHUNPIKE "> Wot you say your name was again? </sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY"> I didn't. <stage> Stan, huddled in an armchair, peeks over The Daily Prophet,
     eyes Harry coolly, before disappearing once more. Harry brushes the fringe of his hair over his
     scar, watches an AMBULANCE -- SIREN WAILING -- careen past. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#STANSHUNPIKE "> Whereabouts you headin'? <stage> Harry hesitates. He hadn't thought
     about this. Decides. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY"> The Leaky Cauldron. That's in London - </sp>
   <sp who="#STANSHUNPIKE "> Is it now? Get that, Ern? The Leaky Cauldron. That's in London. <stage>
     Stan grins with sinister delight, showing BAD TEETH. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#SHRUNKENHEAD "> Leaky Cauldron! Stay away from the pea soup! <stage> As the Shrunken
     Head CACKLES with delight, Harry peers out the windscreen, watches London careering by.
    </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY"> Isn't this a bit... dangerous? </sp>
   <sp who="#STANSHUNPIKE "> Naah. Haven't had an accident in -- what? -- a week is it, Ern? </sp>
   <sp who="#SHRUNKENHEAD "> Heads up! Little old lady at twelve o'clock! <stage> Sure enough,
     directly ahead, a LITTLE OLD LADY is crossing the street. Ernie HITS the BRAKES HARD and Harry
     flies forward, palms to the window. The brakes pinch down, the bus stops inches from the old
     lady, and Harry flies back onto his bed. BANG! The bus rockets forward once more. As Harry
     rights himself, he notices the HEADLINE of Stan's Daily Prophet: ESCAPE FROM AZKABAN! Below, a
     sunken-faced MAN with long, matted hair glowers from a MOVING PHOTOGRAPH. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY"> Who is that? That man. </sp>
   <sp who="#STANSHUNPIKE "> Who is that? That's Sirius Black, that is. Don' tell me you ne'er been
    hearin' o' Sirius Black? <stage> Harry shakes his head, still staring at the man's face.
    </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#STANSHUNPIKE "> A murderer, he is. Got 'imself locked up in Azkaban for it. </sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY"> How'd he escape? </sp>
   <sp who="#STANSHUNPIKE "> Tha's the question, isn't it? He's the firs' that's done it. Gives me
    the collywobbles thinking he's out there, though, I'll tell you that. Big supporter of YouKnow-'
    Oo, Black was. Reckon you heard o' him. <stage> Harry nods and, as he does, Black's eyes shift.
     Meet Harry's. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY"> Yeah. Him I've heard of. <stage> Just then, a pair of DOUBLE-DECKER BUSES sweep
     directly toward the Knight Bus. Before can scream, the entire Knight Bus SQUEEZES DOWN and
     shoots the gap between the two onrushing buses. The Shrunken Head winces. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#SHRUNKENHEAD "> Hate that. </sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY"> This bus. Don't the Muggles ever... </sp>
   <sp who="#STANSHUNPIKE "> Them! Don' listen properly, do they? Don' look properly either. Never
    notice nuffink, they don'. <stage> Just then, a COUPLE walking a DOG are engulfed by a RUSH of
     WIND as the (invisible) Knight Bus WHOOSHES past. The couple glances about in bewilderment. The
     DOG YAPS madly. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#SHRUNKENHEAD "> Turn! Turn! <stage> Ernie fans the wheel, sending the Knight Bus into a
     dizzying 360-degree turn. HEADLIGHTS pinwheel past the windows as the bus rides up on two
     wheels and Harry is sent flying once more. Grabbing fast to the center POLE, he pirouettes
     through the air when Ernie... SLAMS on the BRAKES. </stage></sp>
  </scene>
  <scene>
   <stage cat="EXT" where=" CHARING CROSS ROAD/LEAKY CAULDRON - NIGHT "> The Knight Bus fishtails
    INTO VIEW and SQUEALS to a stop, centimeters from a PARKED CAR. WHOOSH! The bus settles and --
    TINK! -- taps the bumper. Instantly, the car's ALARM wails. </stage>
  </scene>
  <scene>
   <stage cat="INT" where=" THE KNIGHT BUS - SAME TIME - NIGHT "> The chandelier sways drunkenly as
    the bus doors open. The steps GROAN with heavy feet and a FIGURE appears: TOM, Innkeeper of the
    Leaky Cauldron pub. </stage>
   <sp who="#TOM"> Mr. Potter... at last. </sp>
  </scene>
  <scene>
   <stage cat="EXT" where=" LEAKY CAULDRON - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) "> As the Knight Bus rockets off,
    Tom and Harry are revealed, Harry glances up, reads the SIGN above: THE LEAKY CAULDRON. Tom
    drags Harry's trunk inside, then pauses and, with a FLICK of his wand, silences the car alarm.
   </stage>
  </scene>
  <scene>
   <stage cat="INT" where=" LEAKY CAULDRON - BAR/HALLWAY - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) "> Harry trails Tom
    through the quiet room. The BARTENDER glances up, his gaze lingering perhaps a bit too long. A
    solitary WIZARD reads a book while, at his elbow, his COFFEE CUP STIRS ITSELF. Tom leads Harry
    upstairs. </stage>
  </scene>
  <scene>
   <stage cat="INT" where=" LEAKY CAULDRON - BACK ROOM - NIGHT "> As Harry follows Tom inside, he
    finds a SNOW WHITE OWL (HEDWIG) perched atop a chair. Hedwig! </stage>
   <sp who="#HARRY"> </sp>
   <sp who="#TOM"> Right smart bird you've got there, Mr. Potter. Arrived only minutes before
    yourself. A MAN CLEARS his throat. Harry turns, finds a PINSTRIPED SILHOUETTE (CORNELIUS FUDGE)
    at the window, staring at the ghostly shadows beyond. Harry's reflection shivers in the glass,
    but the man doesn't turn. Tom takes a position against the wall, fishes a pair of WALNUTS from
    his pocket and -- CRACK -- crushes the shells between his palms. </sp>
   <sp who="#CORNELIUSFUDGE "> I should tell you, Mr. Potter, earlier this evening your uncle's
    sister was located just south of Sheffield, circling a chimney stack. The Accidental Magic
    Reversal Department was dispatched and she's been properly punctured and her memory modified.
    She has no recollection of the incident whatsoever. <stage> Harry waits. A man condemned. Then
     Fudge turns. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#CORNELIUSFUDGE "> So that's that, and no harm done. <stage>(smiling)</stage> Pea soup?
     <stage> Harry glances warily from the steaming TUREEN of GREEN to Tom, who works a grimy thumb
     into his gum, frees a walnut sliver. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY"> No thank you. Minister... I don't understand. I broke the law. Underage wizards
    aren't allowed to use magic at home - </sp>
   <sp who="#CORNELIUSFUDGE ">
    <stage>(dishing up a bowl)</stage> Oh, come now, Harry. The Ministry doesn't send people to
    Azkaban for blowing up their aunts! On the other hand... running away like that... given the
    state of things... very, very irresponsible. </sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY"> 'The state of things' sir? </sp>
   <sp who="#CORNELIUSFUDGE "> We have a killer on the loose. </sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY"> Sirius Black, you mean. But... what's that got to do with me? <stage> CRACK!
     Tom SHATTERS another WALNUT. Fudge smiles nervously. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#CORNELIUSFUDGE "> Hm? Oh, nothing. You're safe, that's what matters. Tomorrow you'll be
    on your way to Hogwarts. These are your new schoolbooks. I took the liberty of having them
    brought here for you. <stage> Harry eyes the STACK of BOOKS. One is bound by a ROPE.
    </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#CORNELIUSFUDGE "> By the way, Harry. Whilst you're here it would be best if you
    didn't... wander. </sp>
  </scene>
  <scene>
   <stage cat="EXT" where=" LEAKY CAULDRON - ROOM ELEVEN - MORNING "> THROUGH the window: the
    rooftops of London. A TRAIN PASSES and CAMERA PULLS BACK, REVEALS Harry, standing with Hedwig.
    He turns, eyes his schoolbooks. He studies the GROWLING TOME --The Monster Book of Monsters
    --then gives the rope a tug. Instantly... ... the book LEAPS to the floor, pages flying,
    bookcovers SNAPPING. Harry gives chase, then the book turns, begins NIPPING viciously at his
    shoes. Harry vaults atop the bed, watches the book disappear underneath, then grabs a PILLOW.
    Seconds later, the book scuttles into view and Harry POUNCES -- FLUMPH! The BOOK ROARS angrily,
    muffled beneath the pillow. Harry takes the ROPE, prepares to rebind it. </stage>
  </scene>
  <scene>
   <stage cat="INT" where=" LEAKY CAULDRON - HALLWAY/ROOM ELEVEN - MORNING "> A YOUNG WITCH in
    maid's robes pushes a cart down the hall. Harry exits his room as the witch KNOCKS on a door. </stage>
   <sp who="#YOUNGWITCH "> Housekeeping. <stage> As she opens the door, she's greeted by a
     THUNDEROUS ROAR and a RUSH of WIND. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#YOUNGWITCH ">
    <stage>(unperturbed)</stage> I'll come back later. <stage> Something SMALL and FAST dashes by
     Harry's feet. Looking, he spies a rather ragged-looking RAT (SCABBERS), pursued by a decidedly
     UGLY ORANGE CAT (CROOKSHANKS). </stage></sp>
  </scene>
  <scene>
   <stage cat="INT" where=" LEAKY CAULDRON - STAIRWAY - MORNING (MOMENTS LATER) "> As Harry moves
    down the stairs, VOICES come from below. </stage>
   <sp who="#RON"><stage>O.S.</stage> I'm warning you, Hermione! Keep that bloody beast of yours
    away from Scabbers or I'll turn it into a tea cozy. </sp>
   <sp who="#HERMIONE"><stage>O.S.</stage> He's a cat, Ronald! What do you expect? It's in his
    nature. As Harry reaches bottom, he finds RON WEASLEY protectively cradling Scabbers, while
    HERMIONE GRANDER does her best to restrain a HISSING Crookshanks. </sp>
   <sp who="#RON"> A cat! Is that what they told you? Looks more like a pig with hair if you ask me. </sp>
   <sp who="#HERMIONE"> That's rich coming from the owner of that smelly old shoe brush.
     <stage>(cooing to the cat)</stage> It's all right, Crookshanks. You just ignore the mean little
    boy... <stage>Then, sensing another presence in the room, both turn. </stage>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#HERMIONE #RON"> Harry. </sp>

   <stage>CUT TO: CLOSEUP - A DOG-EARED CLIPPING from The Daily Prophet. A HEADLINE SCREAMS: "GRAND
    PRIZE WINNER VISITS EGYPT!" In the accompanying PHOTO, the entire WEASLEY FAMILY stands before
    the GREAT PYRAMIDS, waving. Smack in the middle is Ron, Scabbers perched on his shoulder. </stage>


  </scene>
  <scene>
   <stage cat="INT" where=" LEAKY CAULDRON - MORNING (MOMENTS LATER) "> As Ron smoothes the
    dog-eared clipping onto the table, Harry studies it. Hermione ignores it, stroking Crookshanks. </stage>
   <sp who="#HARRY"> Egypt! What's it like? </sp>
   <sp who="#RON"> Brilliant. It's got loads of old stuff. Mummies. Death masks. Tombs - </sp>
   <sp who="#HERMIONE"> You know, the ancient Egyptians of the Nile River delta worshipped the cat
    goddess Bast. <stage> Ron glares stonily at Hermione, then turns back to Harry. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#RON"> I also got a new wand. <stage> Just then, a COMMOTION is HEARD. The Weasleys --
     PERCY, FRED, GEORGE, GINNY, ARTHUR, and MOLLY -- arrive en masse, laden with purchases from
     Diagon Alley. </stage></sp>

    RATTLING INTAKE OF AIR is heard. The FLAMES in Lupin's hands SPUTTER. A SOUND SWELLS in Harry's

    And then... a SILVERY WHITE LIGHT drifts from his mouth. The world spins off its axis and Harry
    falls... glasses tumbling hard to the ground... then Harry... the muscles of his jaw twitching.
    THUNDER CRACKS. LIGHTNING paints the ICY windows... WHITE. BLACK. WHITE. BLACK... With a

   <sp who="#HAGRID"> Back off, Harry! Back off! <stage> Harry starts to step back, when... Buckbeak
     ducks his beak. Hagrid sighs, relieved. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#HAGRID"> Well done, Harry! Go on. Give 'im a pat. <stage> Tentatively, Harry reaches
     out, lays his hand on Buckbeak's fierce beak. The class CLAPS. Harry smiles. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#HAGRID"> Look at that! I reckon he migh' let yeh ride 'im! </sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY">
    <stage>(smile drooping)</stage> Excuse me? </sp>
   <sp who="#HAGRID"> We'll jus' set yeh behind the wing joint. Mind yeh don' pull any feathers out.
    He won' like that. <stage> Hagrid lifts Harry high, drops him onto Buckbeak's back, and before
     Harry's settled, SLAPS Buckbeak's hindquarters. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#HAGRID"> Off yeh go! <stage> As Buckbeak GALLOPS FORWARD, Harry slides scarily back,
     giant WINGS unfold, huge and powerful, and -- WHOOSH! -they SOAR into the air. Rising higher.
     And higher. And higher. Gradually, Harry loosens his hold on Buckbeak's neck. Losing himself in
     the joy of flying. Smiling at the sight of his and Buckbeak's SHADOW racing across the grass
     below. Circling over the Whomping Willow, past Hogwarts castle, and then SWOOPING, with
     heart-stopping speed, over the Black Lake, Buckbeak's talons tickling the smooth glass of the
     water, summoning the GIANT SQUID to the surface briefly. Hagrid WHISTLES then, and Buckbeak
     wheels, beating his way back to the paddock, galloping to a halt. As Harry slides off, the
     class CHEERS -- all except Draco, who narrows his eyes maliciously. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#HAGRID"> Good work, Harry! <stage>(under his breath)</stage> How'm I doin' me firs'
    day? </sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY"> Brilliant... Professor. <stage> They both grin, when Draco pushes past them
     roughly, strides toward Buckbeak. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#DRACO"> Give me a go at that thing. If Potter can do it, it must be easy. You're not
    dangerous at all, are you, you great ugly brute -- Malfoy! No! </sp>
   <sp who="#HAGRID"> In a flash, Buckbeak's steely talons SLASH DOWN. Malfoy freezes. Looks down at
    the BLOOD BLOSSOMING on his robes. SHRIEKS. Instantly, Harry dashes forward. Buckbeak WHIPS
    AROUND, raises its talons and -- seeing Harry -- lowers them. Ducks its beak. Harry... realizing
    what he's done... breathes. </sp>
   <sp who="#DRACO"> It's killed me! It's killed me! Calm yerself! a scratch... </sp>
   <sp who="#HAGRID"> Yer fine... jus' Hagrid looks: arm. a DEEP GASH glistens on Draco's limp </sp>
   <sp who="#HERMIONE"> Hagrid. He's got to be taken to a hospital. I'll go with you, if you like
    -HAGRID No. I'm the teacher. You all... you all just... Class dismissed! And with that, Hagrid
    -- looking shaken -- swoops up Malfoy, flops him over his shoulder, and lumbers toward the
    castle. </sp>

    inside? </sp>
   <sp who="#SEAMUS">

   <sp who="#HERMIONE"> Ron JUMPS, glances at Hermione, then WHISPERS to Harry. </sp>
   <sp who="#RON"> When'd she get here? </sp>
   <sp who="#HERMIONE"> Boggarts are shape-shifters. They take the shape of whatever a particular
    person fears most. That's what makes it so - </sp>
   <sp who="#LUPIN "> Terrifying, yes. Luckily, a very simple charm exists to repel a
    Boggart. Let's practice it now, shall we? Without wands, please... Riddikulus! </sp>

   <sp who="#DRACO">
    <stage>(muttering softly)</stage> It's this class that's ridiculous. </sp>
   <sp who="#LUPIN "> Good. So much for the easy part. You see, the incantation alone is
    not enough. What really finishes a Boggart off is... laughter. You need to force it to assume a
    shape you find truly amusing. Neville, come up here, will you? <stage> Neville eyes the rattling
     wardrobe, steps forward queasily. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#LUPIN "> What would you say is the thing that frightens you most? </sp>

   <sp who="#NEVILLE"> Yes, but I don't want the Boggart to turn into her either. </sp>
   <sp who="#LUPIN "> It won't. But I want you to picture her clothes, only her clothes,
    very clearly in your mind. Can you do that? </sp>
   <sp who="#NEVILLE">
    <stage>(closing his eyes)</stage> She carries a red handbag... </sp>
   <sp who="#LUPIN "> That's fine. We don't need to hear it. If you see it, we will. Now,
    when I open this wardrobe, Neville, here's what I want you to do... <stage> Lupin leans close to
     Neville, WHISPERS. Neville's eyes POP OPEN in shock. Consider Lupin uncertainly. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#LUPIN "> You can do this, Neville. <stage> Neville nods nervously, takes a
     deep breath. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#LUPIN "> Right then. Wand at the ready. One. Two. Three! <stage> SPARKS jet
     from Lupin's wand, strike the doorknob, and the wardrobe BURSTS OPEN. Instantly, Snape appears,
     eyes flashing hideously as he stalks forward. Neville backs away in fright. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#LUPIN "> Think, Neville. Think! </sp>
   <sp who="#NEVILLE"> R-r-riddikulus! <stage> CRACK! Snape stumbles in a FLASH OF LIGHT and
     reappears... in a LONG, LACE-TRIMMED DRESS, TOWERING MOTH-EATEN HAT, and CRIMSON HANDBAG.
     Instantly, the class ROARS (except for Draco and his fellow Slytherins). Neville blinks,
     amazed, then slowly, grins himself. Lupin drops the needle on an OLD GRAMAPHONE. As a SCRATCHY
     RHUMBA fills the room, he points to Ron. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#LUPIN "> Ron! Forward! <stage> Snape DISSOLVES into a mad whirling mass, then
     mutates into a... GIANT SPIDER. As Ron GASPS, Harry and Hermione exchange an uncertain glance.
     Lupin puts his hands on Ron's shoulders to steady him. Ron raises his wand. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#RON"> Riddikulus! <stage> CRACK! ROLLER SKATES materialize on the spider's hairy feet
     and it begins to shuffle crazily in place. Instantly, Ron relaxes as the class' LAUGHTER rings
     out. </stage></sp>

   <sp who="#PARVATI"> Riddikulus! <stage> As the vampire WHIPS its cloak across its eyes, we CUT
     BEHIND... so our POV is of the students. SWISH! The cloak reopens, the class LAUGHS, and we
     REVERSE again... see that the vampire is now dressed like CARMEN MIRANDA. As it begins to
     SHIMMY about -- against its will --the class starts to CLAP. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#LUPIN "> Mr. Thomas! As Dean steps up, the vampire's undulating body
    attenuates, its skin darkening with diamond-thatched SCALES becoming... a GIANT COBRA. </sp>
   <sp who="#DEANTHOMAS "> Riddikulus! <stage> The cobra's hooded head BOBS back and forth,
     transforms into a JACK-IN-THE-BOX. Lupin grins and... </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#LUPIN "> Next! <stage> ... turns, sees Harry step forward expectantly. Concern
     flickers through Lupin's face. The Jack-In-The-Box pivots on its spring, its face tumbling
     toward Harry, becoming more sinister, transforming into a... ... Dementor. Suddenly the MUSIC
     FADES. Harry starts to raise his wand, then... freezes, transfixed. The Dementor looms closer
     and closer, when... ... Lupin steps between, snaps his wand. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#LUPIN "> Here! <stage> CRACK! -- the Dementor vanishes and a ROILING MIST
     appears, which becomes CLOUDS. Something glows within the clouds, white, silvery and round...
    </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#LUPIN "> Riddikulus! <stage> POP! The orb deflates like a punctured balloon,
     WHIZZES crazily about the room, then darts back into the wardrobe. The door SLAMS SHUT and the
     CLASS CHEERS. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#LUPIN "> Well done, everyone. I think that's enough excitement for today.
     <stage> As the students exit, chattering loudly, only Harry, subdued, remains behind. At the

   <sp who="#LUPIN "> You'd like to know why I stopped you from facing the Boggart.
     <stage>(off Harry's surprise)</stage> I should think it'd be obvious. I assumed the Boggart
    would take the shape of Lord Voldemort. <stage> Harry frowns. Lupin studies him curiously.
    </stage></sp>

    your scar. By your eyes. They're your mother Lily's. <stage>(nodding)</stage> Yes. I knew her.
    She was there for me at a time when no one else was. We used to talk for hours. She was not only
    a singularly gifted witch but an uncommonly kind woman. She had a way of seeing the beauty in
    whoever she met, even -- and perhaps most especially -- when that person couldn't see it in
    themselves... <stage> Lupin's eyes glaze in memory, then he blinks, smiles. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#LUPIN "> Which perhaps explains her affection for your father. James had,
    shall we say, a certain talent for trouble. A gift, rumor has it, he passed on to you. <stage>
     Lupin turns, eyes Harry affectionately. Harry smiles vaguely. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#LUPIN "> I could tell you stories -- and there are many about your parents,

   <sp who="#HERMIONE"> Please, sir, an Animagus is a wizard who elects to turn into an animal. A
    werewolf has no choice in the matter. Furthermore, the werewolf actively hunts humans and
    responds only to the call of its own kind -- Malfoy lets out a LOW HOWL. </sp>
   <sp who="#SNAPE"> Quiet, Malfoy! Though one must admit to feeling your pain. That is the second
    time you have spoken out of turn, Miss Granger. Tell me. Are you incapable of restraining
    yourself? Or do you take pride in being an insufferable know-it-all? </sp>
   <sp who="#RON">
    <stage>(to Harry)</stage> He's got a point, you know. <stage> Harry stares at the parchment.
     Malfoy has drawn a crude caricature of Harry in his Quidditch robes being STRUCK BY LIGHTNING
     over and over. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#SNAPE"> Five points from Gryffindor! <stage>(to the class)</stage> As a antidote to
    your ignorance, I prescribe two rolls of parchment on the werewolf by Monday morning, with
    particular emphasis placed on recognizing it. <stage>(suddenly)</stage> Passing notes, Potter?
     <stage> Snape SNATCHES the drawing from under Harry's nose. Eyes it. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#SNAPE"> Not exactly Picasso, are you? I hope you demonstrate more talent on the
    Quidditch pitch this weekend then you do as an artist. If not, I fear you'll perish, given the
    weather forecast. Until that time, however, you'll forgive me if I don't let you off homework.
    Should you die, I assure you... you need not hand it in. <stage> As Snape turns away, Malfoy
     sniggers with Crabbe, Coyle and PIKE. Harry glances down at the drawing once more and we hear a
     true RUMBLE of THUNDER and -CUT TO: ... a STITCH OF LIGHTNING... </stage></sp>
  </scene>
  <scene>
   <stage cat="EXT" where=" QUIDDITCH PITCH - A STITCH OF LIGHTNING - DAY "> as it strikes one of
    the GOLDEN QUIDDITCH RINGS and the clouds bloom with ICY BLUE light. Far below, in the stands,
    RAIN lashes the SEA OF UMBRELLAS. As one flies free, soaring end over end into the sky, the...
    ... CROWD EXPLODES and two Quidditch squads -- Gryffindor in SCARLET, Hufflepuff in
    CANARY-YELLOW -- shoot into the air. Twin BLUDGERS FIRE skyward, and the match is on. We CUT
    INTO Harry, rising like a rocket through the mist, his robes SNAPPING VIOLENTLY in the wind.
    INTERCUT HARRY'S POV -- as he flies, RAIN falling like NEEDLES before him, every dark cloud
    concealing potential danger. Beaters crisscross his path. A BLUDGER WHIZZES past, then a second
    ROCKETS DIRECTLY AT HIM. SWOOP! -- Harry ducks, watches the BLUDGER SHATTER the BROOM of a
    HUFFLEPUFF BEATER. The Beater goes into a wild spiral, vanishes in the mist. </stage>
  <stage> IN THE STANDS Ron squints upward, the players little more than STREAKING BLURS
     from his vantage. KA-SSSST! A STITCH OF LIGHTNING strikes the TAIL of ANGELINA JOHNSON'S broom.
     As it BURSTS into FLAMES, she PLUMMETS to the pitch. Ron looks down at his own HAND. In the
     HIGHLY-CHARGED AIR, the HAIR above his knuckles RISES. In the sky, Harry flies fearlessly,
     searching for the Snitch as Bludgers pierce the clouds above him and CHASERS flit IN and OUT OF
     VIEW far below. Suddenly, in the stands opposite, a BLACK UMBRELLA flies from the hand of a
     RAVENCLAW GIRL. For a moment, it sails wondrously through the heavy air, a Magritte dream, then
     -- WHOOP! WHOOP! WHOOP! -- abruptly picks up speed, ROTATING LIKE A HATCHET. Harry DUCKS,
     turns, and watches it disappear into a bank of clouds. Then... ... something GLIMMERS: the
     Snitch. Instantly, Harry jets off closing fast on the tiny, glimmering ball, chasing it through
     one cloud... then another... and another... until... ... he BREAKS into a clear patch of sky...
     only to find the Snitch is gone. Angrily, Harry whips the Nimbus back around, searching the
     horizon frantically, when he spies something: In the stadium's HIGHEST TOWER, something
     ENORMOUS flickers briefly in SILHOUETTE, then is obscured by a veil of mist. Harry turns. In
     the distance, the stray umbrella spins INTO VIEW, harpoons a player. Harry's eyes shift. The
     SNITCH SHIMMERS like a FIREFLY in the dark underbelly of a cloud. Harry begins to go... when
     the veil of mist shrouding the high tower shifts and -- for one brief moment -- a GREAT DOG is
     revealed. As this mist closes, Harry frowns, jets away. As Harry pelts after the Snitch, the
     crowd RISES TO THEIR FEET, ROARING. Ron GRINS over the binoculars, watching Harry shred the
     mist as he urges his broom on. </stage>
   <sp who="#HARRY"> Come on! Faster! <stage> The trace of a smile forms on Harry's lips as he
     closes on the Snitch... only yards away... reaching out... when... ... a THIN GLAZE of ICE
     clouds his GLASSES. He wipes at them, then flinches: BLOOD trickles down his cheek. The rain is
     turning to needles. Needles of ice. Harry glances at the HANDLE of his BROOMSTICK. The water
     sluicing through the grain is FREEZING. VAPOR streams from his mouth and nose. SWOOSH! A dark
     SILHOUETTE passes on his right. He turns. SWOOSH! -- a twin SILHOUETTE passes on his left.
     Harry sees neither. Looks down. The layers of mist are parting below. LIGHTNING STRIKES.
     Reveals: an ARMY OF SILHOUETTES drifting onto the pitch. A vast legion of them... </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#DEMENTORS. "><stage> A DISTANT WHISTLE weaves into the WIND, rises in pitch, not a
     whistle at all, but a... SCREAM. A WOMAN'S SCREAM. Harry's eyes flutter, and wisps of SILVERY
     WHITE LIGHT float from his mouth. His glasses glaze over completely. His fingers, rigid, can no
     longer grip the broom and... He FALLS. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#HERMIONE"> No!!! </sp>
   <stage>Harry and broom tumble in opposite directions. The Nimbus soars end over end, tossed by
    the currents, then drops... right into the Whomping Willow. FLOOMPH! Harry, in freefall, drops
    through one cloud, then another. Plummeting through the circling Dementors. Then... a TALL
    FIGURE rises from the crowd. Raises an OPEN HAND to the heavens. Eyes angry but clear.
    Dumbledore. An EXPLOSION -- more powerful than thunder -- rocks the air. A FLASH -- more fierce
    than lightning -- shocks the sky. And then... THE SCREEN GOES BLACK. Not a sound. For the

   <stage cat="INT" where=" ASTRONOMY ROOM - DUSK "> The DYING SUN streams through high windows,
    painting Harry's face a fierce AMBER-RED as he stands opposite Lupin. ANCIENT CHARTS drape the
    walls while gleaming SPHERES OF SPUN GLASS ORBIT one another silently. Lupin paces before a
    LARGE TRUNK. </stage>
   <sp who="#LUPIN "> You're sure about this, Harry? This is very advanced magic. Well
    beyond Ordinary Wizarding Level. </sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY"> If Black can fight the Dementors, I need to know how too. <stage> Lupin studies
     Harry -- as if conflicted -- then decides. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#LUPIN "> Very well. The spell I'm going to teach you is called the Patronus
    Charm. Ever hear of it? <stage> Harry shakes his head. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#LUPIN "> A Patronus is a kind of positive force. For the wizard who can
    conjure one, the Patronus works something like a shield. The Dementor feeds on it instead of
    him. <stage> Just then, the trunk RATTLES VIOLENTLY. As Harry's eyes wander, Lupin SNAPS his
     fingers, brings his attention back. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#LUPIN "> But in order for it to work, you must think of a memory. And not just
    any. This memory needs to be a very happy one. And powerful. <stage> Harry thinks a bit. Then...
     nods. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#LUPIN "> Got something? Good. Let it fill you up. Lose yourself in it. Then
    speak the incantation: Expecto Patronum. Without your wand... </sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY"> Expecto Patronum... </sp>
   <sp who="#LUPIN "> Right then. Shall we? <stage> Harry nods, raises his wand. Lupin,
     watching closely, reaches over, grips the lid of the TRUNK... </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#LUPIN "> Concentrate, Harry. Concentrate... <stage> As Lupin FLINGS open the
     case, Harry OPENS HIS EYES. In the sun's BLOOD-LIGHT, the Dementor looks particularly horrific.
    </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY"> Expecto... Patronum... <stage> The torches on the wall FLICKER as a CHILL
     BREEZE fills the chamber. A SCREAM ECHOES distantly. Harry's hand trembles. His eyes begin to
     roll up... </stage></sp>

     ORB. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#LUPIN "> Riddikulus! <stage> Lupin flicks his wand, sends the orb back into
     the packing case. Harry stands blinking. Dazed. Lupin fishes a CHOCOLATE FROG from his pocket.
     Presses it into Harry's trembling hand. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#LUPIN "> Quickly. <stage> Harry studies the frog. Takes a bite. Begins to
     recover. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY"> That's one nasty Dementor. </sp>
   <sp who="#LUPIN "> Boggart, Harry. The real thing would be much, much worse. Just out of
    interest, what were you thinking of? What memory did you choose? </sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY"> The first time I rode a broom. </sp>
   <sp who="#LUPIN "> That's not good enough, Harry. Not nearly. <stage> Harry glances
     toward the window, at the bloody sun. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY"> There's another. It's not happy exactly. I mean, it is. It's the happiest I've
    ever felt. But it's... complicated. </sp>
   <sp who="#LUPIN "> Is it strong? <stage> Harry looks up into Lupin's eyes. Emotional.
     Nods. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#LUPIN "> Then let's try it. <stage> Harry takes a breath. Tosses the frog
     aside. Poises himself. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#LUPIN "> Think, Harry, think - </sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY"> Just do it! <stage> Lupin blinks at Harry's quiet fierceness. Opens the packing
     case. Instantly, the Dementor appears again. A chill fills the air. The hair skates off Harry's
     scar. He sets his jaw... </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY"> Expecto Patronum! <stage> Harry's hand TREMBLES. His whole BODY TREMBLES. But
     he holds his ground, when -- WHOOSH! -- a huge SILVER SHADOW BURSTS from the end of his wand,
     hovering between him and the Dementor. The Dementor falters... Harry's legs like water...

   <sp who="#LUPIN "> So you know, Harry: You'd have given your father a run for his money.
    And, believe me, that's saying something. Harry ponders this. Then speaks, deep inside himself. </sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY"> I was thinking of him. And Mum. Seeing their faces. They're just talking to me.
    Just... talking. That was the memory I chose. I don't even know if it's real... <stage> Harry

    Buckbeak. Harry and the others duck behind the pumpkins, watch Hagrid solemnly greet the others.
    Fudge appears at the window. Picks his nose. Just then, a Shhh! is heard. Hermione turns. The

    QUARTET OF BLEAK SHADOWS files from the hut. One of the SHADOWS -Dumbledore -- raises his hand
    and points, directing the attention of the others away from Buckbeak. Dumbledore speaks briefly
    -- unintelligible from this distance, then -- CAW! CAW! -- The crows SHRIEK excitedly and the
    Executioner separates from the others, disappears behind a LOW STAND OF TREES. DING! All goes
    very still. The wind loses its voice... DING! Sunlight kicks off the axe as it rises over the
    trees, INTO VIEW... DING! The ax hangs seemingly forever, etched against the sky, then drops
    from sight. A SICKENING CHOP! fouls the breeze and Ron and Harry stare toward the trees in numb
    disbelief. Hermione, face turned away, trembles... DING! The SUN sets, dropping behind the
    mountains in the distance. Hermione turns. Sees a frenzied spray of crows stain the bloody sky,
    their PRIMAL SHRIEKING rising like a curse. Slowly, Hermione's hand falls onto Ron's shoulder
    and CAMERA FALLS WITH her, CONTINUING DOWN the length of Ron's arm to his hand, where a DROP OF
    BLOOD hangs from his finger, drops like a tear... DING! Ron stares at his hand. At the blood

   <sp who="#RON"> Harry! Run! <stage> Harry's eyes shift. Bounding toward him in the gathering
     gloom is an ENORMOUS, PALE-EYED, JET-BLACK... DOG. Harry shields himself when... the dog LEAPS
     CLEAR OVER HIM. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#RON"> Aaaahhh! <stage> The dog's TEETH flash and -- SNAP! -- close on Ron's foot,
     dragging him TOWARDS THE TRUNK like a rag doll. Instantly, Harry dashes forward, leaps out, and
     grabs Ron's hands... but he and Ron just keep skudding along the ground. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#HERMIONE"> I've got you -<stage> Hermione pitches herself onto Harry's feet... and the
     three of them go scudding along. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#RON"> Harry! <stage> Harry raises his chin. The dog vanishes into the GAP at the base
     of the tree, begins to pull Ron through... </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY"> Hold on, Ron! <stage> But it's no use. The dog is too powerful. Harry glances
     around desperately, then finds himself looking directly in Ron's eyes. He can read his mind.
    </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY"> No, Ron... <stage> One by one, Ron releases his fingers from Harry's forearm.
     Sacrificing himself. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY"> Nooooo!!! </sp>
   <stage>But Ron closes his eyes, releases his hands fully, and... Disappears. As his VOICE ECHOES
    deep into the earth... Harry and Hermione rise, peer into the hole. WHOMP! The Whomping Willow
    sweeps first Hermione, then Harry, into the air and -- FLOOMPH -- drops them on their backsides.
    HARRY AND HERMIONE'S POV - THE BRANCHES OVERHEAD Swaying beautifully against the dusky sky,
    swishing softly. BACK TO SCENE As one, they rise. Run back toward the gap in the tree. A branch
    swoops down. Hermione ducks. Harry doesn't. WHOOSH -- he is flung one way, his GLASSES the
    other. Hermione HOPS over another branch -- looks briefly pleased with herself -- only to find
    herself SWEPT HIGH IN THE AIR by a second branch. She looks down, sees Harry searching the
    ground for his glasses. </stage>

   <sp who="#HERMIONE"> Haaaaaaarrrrrr!!!!!!!!! <stage> Harry squints up, sees a PILE-DRIVING FIST
     of a branch screaming straight down for his head. He rolls away just as -- WHOMP! -- the branch
     PULVERIZES the ground. Hermione WHIPS THROUGH FRAME, still clinging on for dear life, and Harry
     rises. FLUMPH! -- he's promptly knocked to the ground again. Hermione goes CRASHING through the
     high branches, Harry spies his glasses and grabs them. Rising, he fits them to his face and...

   <stage cat="INT" where=" SHRIEKING SHACK - DECREPIT ROOM - NIGHT "> Harry pulls Hermione up.
    Looks about. Paper peels from the walls. Stains -- suspiciously similar to dried blood -- blot

   <sp who="#HERMIONE"> We're in the Shrieking Shack, aren't we? <stage> Harry doesn't answer,
     staring at the DOG PRINTS in the DUST on the floor. The CEILING CREAKS. They dash to the

     follows the PAW PRINTS on the floor to a pair of FILTHY HUMAN FEET. Harry looks up slowly at
     the MAN standing in the shadows. Filthy, matted hair hangs to his shoulders. His skin like a
     corpse. SIRIUS BLACK. He studies Harry's face keenly. Harry draws his wand. </stage></sp>

   <sp who="#HERMIONE"> Harry! No! <stage> Just then, FOOTSTEPS sound. Black wheels toward the door,

     Harry cautiously. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#SIRIUS"> Going to kill me, Harry? </sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY"> Yes. <stage>Harry raises his wand. BLAM! -- the DOOR CRASHES OPEN: Lupin.

   <sp who="#HARRY #HERMIONE #RON"> Professor Lupin! <stage>Lupin ignores them, eying Black
     intensely. </stage>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#LUPIN "> Looking a bit ragged, aren't we, Sirius? Finally the skin reflects
    the madness within. </sp>
   <sp who="#SIRIUS"> You'd know all about the madness within, wouldn't you, Remus? <stage>
     The two regard each other, the moment taut with tension, then Lupin steps forward and...
     EMBRACES Black like a brother. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#HERMIONE"> No! I trusted you! I covered up for you. And all this time you've been his
    friend! <stage>(pointing)</stage> He's a werewolf! That's why he's been missing classes! <stage>
     Harry and Ron stare, dumbfounded, at Lupin. Black HOWLS then, bitterly amused. Lupin eyes him,
     then turns back. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#LUPIN "> How long have you known? </sp>
   <sp who="#HERMIONE"> Since Professor Snape set the essay. </sp>
   <sp who="#LUPIN "> You're the brightest witch of your age I've ever met, Hermione. </sp>
   <sp who="#SIRIUS"> Yes, you glow like the sun. And you howl at the moon. Enough talk! He
    dies. Now. If you won't do it with me, Remus, I'll do it alone. </sp>

   <sp who="#LUPIN "> All right then. As you wish... </sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY"> No! <stage> Harry raises his wand when Lupin wheels and, with a flick of his
     own, disarms him. Furious, Harry eyes Black murderously. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY"> You betrayed my parents! You sold them to Voldemort! </sp>
   <sp who="#SIRIUS"> It's a lie! I never would've betrayed James and Lily! </sp>
   <sp who="#LUPIN "> Harry! You've got to listen - </sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY"> Did he listen! When my mother was dying! Did he hear her screaming! </sp>
   <sp who="#SIRIUS"> No! I wasn't there! And I'll regret it the rest of my life! Harry's eyes
    flash to Black's, glittering with pain. </sp>
   <sp who="#LUPIN "> Someone else betrayed your parents, Harry. Someone in this room right
    now. Someone who, until quite recently, I believed to be dead. </sp>
   <sp who="#SIRIUS"> He's as good as dead. </sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY"> What're you talking about? There's nobody here. </sp>
   <sp who="#SIRIUS"> Oh yes there is... <stage> Black turns then, to Ron, and CROONS in a
     cruel sing song: </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#SIRIUS"> Come out, come out, Peter Come out, come out and play... <stage> Ron
     draws back from Black's demented gaze. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#RON"> You're mad... <stage> Harry's eyes shift from Ron's FACE to his HANDS, where
     Scabbers TWISTS violently. As a curious expression befalls Harry, Lupin and Black, as one,
     raise their wands... when. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#SNAPE"> Expelliarmus! <stage> The wands fly from their hands. The others turn, find

   <sp who="#LUPIN "> Severus - </sp>
   <sp who="#SNAPE"> I told Dumbledore you were helping your old friend into the castle. And here's
    the proof. </sp>
   <sp who="#SIRIUS"> Brilliant! And -- as usual -dead wrong. Now give us our wands back.
    Remus and I have a bit of unfinished business to tend to. <stage> As Black approaches, Snape
     puts his wand to Black's neck. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#SNAPE"> Give me a reason. I beg you. </sp>
   <sp who="#LUPIN "> Don't be a fool, Severus! </sp>
   <sp who="#SIRIUS"> He can't help it. It's habit by now. </sp>
   <sp who="#LUPIN "> Quiet, Sirius! </sp>
   <sp who="#SNAPE">
    <stage>(clucking his tongue)</stage> Listen to you two. Quarreling like an old married couple.
    The creature and the criminal. </sp>
   <sp who="#SIRIUS"> Piss off. </sp>
   <sp who="#SNAPE"> Witty as ever I see. Tell me, will you be so irreverent when I turn you over to
    the Dementors? <stage>(as Black reacts)</stage> Do I detect a flicker of fear? One can only
    imagine what it must be like to endure the Dementor's Kiss. It's said to be unbearable to
    witness. But I'll do my best. <stage> Snape's eyes harden. He gestures to the door.
    </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#SNAPE"> After you. <stage> As the others start to go, Harry glances at the table where
     Lupin has left Harry's wand. In a flash, it's in his hand. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY"> Expelliarmus! <stage> Snape soars into the air, hits the wall with a THUD, and
     slides down. Ron and Hermione stare in shock. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#HERMIONE"> Harry. You attacked a teacher. <stage> Harry looks a bit shocked himself,
     then turns to Black. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY"> You said Peter before. Peter who? </sp>
   <sp who="#LUPIN "> Pettigrew. He was at school with us. We thought he was a friend. </sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY"> No. Pettigrew's dead. He killed him. <stage> As Harry points at Black, Black
     laughs mirthlessly. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#LUPIN "> I thought so, too. Until you mentioned seeing Pettigrew on the Map. </sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY"> The Map was lying then - </sp>
   <sp who="#SIRIUS"> The Map never lies. Pettigrew's alive. And he's right there. <stage>
     Black points at... Ron. Ron goes white with fear. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#RON"> M-me? It's lunatic... </sp>
   <sp who="#SIRIUS"> Not you, you idiot. Your rat. </sp>
   <sp who="#RON"> Scabbers? Scabbers has been in my family for - </sp>
   <sp who="#SIRIUS">
    <stage>(bitterly)</stage> Twelve years. A curiously long life for a common garden rat. He's
    missing a toe, isn't he? <stage> Black unfolds a dog-eared clipping from The Daily Prophet: it
     shows Ron in Egypt with his family, Scabbers on his shoulder. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#RON"> So what? </sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY"> All they could find of Pettigrew was his - </sp>
   <sp who="#SIRIUS"> Finger. Dirty coward cut it off so everyone would think he was dead.
    Then he transformed into a rat. <stage> Harry stares into Black's sunken eyes. Wanting to
     believe. Desperate to believe. Glances at Ron, his agonized face. Scabbers SQUIRMS VIOLENTLY.
    </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY"> Show me. <stage> Lupin and Black turn to Ron. He holds Scabbers protectively.
    </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#RON"> What are you going to do to him? <stage> Sirius and Lupin exchange a glance.
    </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#SIRIUS"> Together. <stage> With that, Lupin takes out his wand and, as one, he
     and Black cast a stream of BLUE-WHITE LIGHT. Scabbers twists madly in midair, then -- FLASH! --
     transforms into... a very short man with thinning hair and grubby hands. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#PETERPETTIGREW. "> </sp>
   <sp who="#PETTIGREW"> S-Sirius... R-Remus. My old friends. <stage> Neither speaks. Pettigrew's
     small, watery eyes dart toward the windows and door. Suddenly, he makes a break for it, but
     Sirius merely shoves him back. Pettigrew's nose twitches, his gaze finding Harry. His hands
     flutter nervously, reveal a MISSING INDEX FINGER. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#PETTIGREW"> Harry! Look at you! Y-you look just like your father. Like James. We were
    the best of friends, he and I - </sp>
   <sp who="#SIRIUS"> Shut up! </sp>
   <sp who="#PETTIGREW"> I didn't mean to! The Dark Lord, you have no idea the weapons he possesses!
    Ask yourself what you would have done, Sirius. What would you have done! </sp>
   <sp who="#SIRIUS"> Died! Died rather than betray my friends! And you should have realized,
    Peter, if Voldemort didn't kill you... </sp>
   <sp who="#LUPIN "> We would. </sp>

    Haven't I been a good friend? A good pet? You won't let them kill me, will you? I was your
    rat... <stage> Ron draws back in disgust. Pettigrew turns to Hermione. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#PETTIGREW"> Sweet girl. Clever girl. Surely you won't let them... <stage> As one, Lupin
     and Black raise their wands, point them directly into Pettigrew's face. He shrinks back
     trembling, closing his eyes in fear, when... </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY"> No. <stage> Pettigrew's lids lift. Lupin and Black turn. Staggered.

     twitching, SHAKES HIS HEAD. Pettigrew's eyes dart, taking in the situation, then slowly shift,
     note the WAND trembling in LUPIN'S LENGTHENING FIST. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#SIRIUS"> Run. All of you. Now. <stage> But none of them do, transfixed, watching
     as BRISTLES POKE THROUGH LUPIN'S SKIN. Black steps forward, wraps his arms around his friend,
     presses his mouth to his ear. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#SIRIUS"> You know the man you truly are, Remus. This flesh is only flesh.
     <stage>(pounding Lupin's chest)</stage> This heart is where you truly live. This heart! Here!
     <stage> As Lupin's WAND DROPS... Pettigrew LEAPS. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY"> No! <stage>(flashing his wand)</stage> Expelliarmus! <stage> Lupin's wand flies
     from Pettigrew's hand and he FREEZES. Then slowly turns. Face blank, eyes closed, he... GRINS
     HIDEOUSLY. Transforms. Stunned, Harry watches a RAT dart into the night. A HOWL PIERCES THE AIR
     and Harry wheels. With a shrug, Lupin tosses Black into the air, then turns. He is no longer
     human. He's a werewolf. Harry and Hermione begin to edge back. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#HERMIONE"> Professor...? <stage> The WEREWOLF'S eyes blaze. Long teeth glitter. Then...
     a horrifying GROWL ERUPTS from its throat. Harry and Hermione spin, begin to flee... and run
     flat into Snape. As they collapse in a great clumsy pile, Snape's eyes flutter open, the spell
     broken. Seeing Hermione atop him, he sweeps her aside... </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#SNAPE"> Out of the way! <stage> ... and finds the werewolf preparing to pounce. Leaping
     to his feet, Snape draws his wand and steps forward, shielding Hermione, Harry and Ron. The
     WEREWOLF HOWLS, SPRINTS forward, when -- SWOOSH! -- a GIANT DOG (Black) intercepts it in
     MIDAIR. They hit the ground in a FIERCE TANGLE of FLASHING TEETH, a single horrible flailing
     beast. Again and again, the dog pushes the werewolf back, but the werewolf is too strong...
    </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY"> Sirius! <stage> The DOG YELPS, ROARS in pain, and the werewolf flings it into
     the tall grass. As it charges after, Harry pushes past Snape, dashes into the night. Hermione
     makes to follow, but Snape holds her back. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#HERMIONE"> Harry! <stage> Harry runs full out. Up ahead, FRAMED AGAINST A FULL MOON, he
     spies the dog, lying inert, the werewolf's razor-sharp claws suspended over its neck.
    </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY"> NO!!! <stage> Desperately, Harry plucks a THICK BRANCH from the ground and
     hurls it with all his might. Bull's-eye. The werewolf freezes. Turns. Begins to move toward...
     Harry. Harry draws his wand, terrified, but tormented as well, knowing Lupin dwells somewhere
     within the beast. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY"> Please, Professor. Stop... It's me. <stage> Suddenly... a HOWL pierces the
     night. The werewolf falters, cocking its head toward the forest. Harry waits, petrified. The
     WEREWOLF's eyes shift back to him. It SNARLS, moves closer, ready to kill. Harry covers his
     face with his arm, when... ... a SECOND HOWL ECHOES high above the forest. Slowly, Harry drops
     his arm. Looks. The werewolf bounds toward the forest, vanishes. Harry's eyes shift. In the
     darkness, the wounded dog lurches through the tall grass. Falls. Rises. Falls again. Each time
     becoming more human. As he disappears over the ridge, Harry sprints after. </stage></sp>

   <sp who="#HARRY"> Sirius! <stage> A fragile MIST escapes Harry's mouth. A raw WIND TOSSES his
     hair. CHILL-BUMPS pebble his SKIN. A FRINGE of ICE appears at the lake's edge. Then they
     appear, oozing like smoke through the TREES across the lake. Dementors. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY"> No... No! <stage>(drawing his wand)</stage> Expecto... Patronum! <stage> A thin
     silvery wisp weeps from Harry's wand, hovering like a VEIL, but the Dementors continue to come.
     Harry places his hand on Black's HEAVING HEART, poises his wand once more: </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY"> Expecto... Patronum... </sp>
   <stage>Harry's Patronus blooms briefly... and dies. Harry's eyes flutter, the DEMENTORS twisting
    madly in his vision, drawing closer. Black GASPS. SILVERY FEATHERS of LIGHT tumble from his
    lips, as if his very soul were leaving him... Then... a LIGHT splinters the trees. Harry
    squints, sees a FIERY STAG appear... its body luminous... slashing through the trees... sowing
    light in the darkness. The Dementors wilt in its wake, but more replace them, sweeping down in
    waves. Still, the stag charges on. The LIGHT EXPANDS. The forest blazing with it. The remaining
    Dementors flee, drifting across the moon like ash. The light ebbs. The stag's luminous body
    flickers. There is a BRIGHT FLASH and darkness returns, a single THREAD of LIGHT all that
    remains, spinning down to the size of a PEARL... in the palm of MAN, standing deep in the trees.
    Harry studies the strangely familiar SILHOUETTE, then... it is gone. Silence drops like a
    curtain. MIST rises from the lake. As Snape appears at the top of the rise, we - FADETO BLACK.

    with considerable fascination. Caught -- regards Harry defensively. </stage>
   <sp who="#HERMIONE"> What? </sp>

   <sp who="#HERMIONE"> No! Fudge has to see Buckbeak before we steal him. Otherwise, he'll think

     Just then... on the ground beside her... Hermione notices a JAGGED STAR-SHAPED STONE.

     Quickly, Hermione and Harry dash into the trees directly behind... just in time to see
     themselves -- along with Ron -- exit the back door and slip behind the pumpkin pile where, only
     seconds before, they were hiding. As Fudge appears at the window and picks his nose as before,

   <sp who="#HERMIONE"> Is that really what my hair looks like from the back? </sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY"> Shhh! <stage> Hermione sees herself turn. Ducking, she accidentally stirs the

     she hears her own voice: </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#HERMIONE"><stage>O.S.</stage> Nothing, I just thought I saw... Never mind. <stage>
     Harry and Hermione watch themselves start up the slope. The coast clear, they slip out of the

     curiously, a ferret leg dangling from his beak. Harry bows. SLURP! The ferret leg disappears

     charges into the clearing, screening Harry and Hermione. The WEREWOLF SNARLS ANGRILY, makes to
     charge. With lightning-fast reflexes, Buckbeak's claws slash the air... only inches from the
     werewolf's face. The werewolf stops, eyes glittering with rage, then... HOWLS. Turning, it
     vanishes into the forest. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#HERMIONE"> Poor Professor Lupin is having a really tough night... <stage> Just then, a
     CHILL WIND rises... The LEAVES of the trees TREMBLE... EERIE SHADOWS flutter over the moon,
     greasy as smoke... Dementors. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY"> Let's go. </sp>

    attempt to conjure a Patronus as the cyclone only continues to grow... </stage>
   <sp who="#HERMIONE"> This is horrible... </sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY"> Don't worry. My Dad will come... Right there... you'll see... he'll come... any
    minute... he'll conjure the Patronus <stage> Hermione eyes Harry warily. He is transfixed,
     staring hungrily toward the outcrop. The WIND RISES. The Lake begins to freeze. WHOOSH! WHOOSH!
     One after another, Dementors drop from the sky, vanish in the cyclone... </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#HERMIONE"> No one's coming, Harry... HE WILL! </sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY"> He will come! <stage> She looks. Nothing. Desperately, her eyes flash to the
     cyclone, to the pitiful sight of Harry and Black at the water's edge... wracked with pain...
     dying... </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#HERMIONE"> No one's coming! You're dying, both of you... and no one's coming! <stage>
     Harry's face changes. A riddle unravels. He draws his wand. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#HERMIONE"> HARRY, NO! <stage> Too late. Harry slashes through the trees, down to the
     rocky outcrop, to the exact spot where his father appeared. Poising his wand, he looks out over
     the sea of Dementors on the other side of the lake. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY"> EXPECTO PATRONUM! <stage> A WISP of SILVER escapes his wand, hovering like a
     MIST, then BLOOMS MAGNIFICENTLY. The trees EXPLODE WITH LIGHT. The Lake BLAZES with reflected
     FIRE. Harry stands utterly still, wand extended to the heavens. Across the lake, the Dementors
     retreat. Harry waits, still as a statue, until each and every one is gone. Then he simply lets
     his arm drop. </stage></sp>

   <sp who="#HARRY"> You were right, Hermione. It wasn't my dad I saw earlier. It was... me. I saw
    myself conjuring the Patronus before. I knew I could do it this time, because... because I'd
    already done it. Does that make sense? <stage> Hermione contemplates this. </stage></sp>

     haggard eyes. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#LUPIN "> Saw you coming. <stage> The Marauder's Map lies open on an otherwise

    well... let's just say I'm used to this by now. But before I go, tell me about your Patronus. </sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY"> Well. At first I thought it was a horse, or perhaps a unicorn, but I think it
    was - </sp>
   <sp who="#LUPIN "> A stag. </sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY"> Yes. </sp>
   <sp who="#LUPIN "> Your father used to transform into one. That's how he was able to

     lifts his sorry suitcase. Then stops. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#LUPIN "> There are stories about him and your mother, you know. Some are even
    true. But I think it's safe to say in the end, you'll know them best by getting to know
    yourself. <stage> Lupin then -- with a wicked twinkle -- raises his wand. </stage></sp>

    something else is clear as he JETS PAST and... The SCREEN GOES BLACK. It's a SCREAM of joy.
