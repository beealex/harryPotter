                    frowns, then attempts to generate something by CLAPPING his hands once. A few

                a young man who, like you, sat in this very Hall. Walked this castle’s corridors.
                Slept beneath its roof. He seemed, to all the world, a student like any other. His
                name? Tom Riddle. </sp>

                Each day, every hour, this very minute perhaps, dark forces attempt to penetrate
                this castle. But in the end, their greatest weapon remains... you. <stage> Harry
                    eyes Malfoy, slouched low, lazily levitating a fork with his wand, as if

            <sp who="#RON"> Ron Weasley, sir. But I’m dead awful at Potions, a menace actually, so I
                probably should just be going - </sp>
            <sp who="#SLUGHORN"> Nonsense, we’ll sort you out. Any friend of Harry’s is a friend of
                mine. Right then, books out - </sp>

            <sp who="#SLUGHORN"> Not to worry. You can get what you need from the cupboard. <stage>
                    As Harry and Ron step to the cupboard, Slughorn resumes, gesturing to the
                    cauldrons bubbling before him. </stage></sp>
            <sp who="#SLUGHORN"> Now, as I was saying, I’ve prepared a few concoctions this morning.
                Any ideas what these might be? Yes, Miss...? </sp>
            <sp who="#HERMIONE"> Granger, sir. That one there is Veritaserum. And that would be
                Polyjuice Potion. And that... <stage> In the cupboard, Harry and Ron find two
                    TEXTBOOKS -- one new, one shabby and soiled. Both snatch for the new when a box
                    -- marked “BEZOARS” -- tips. As Harry makes a grab for it, Ron wrests free the
                    new textbook and goes off grinning. </stage></sp>
            <sp who="#HERMIONE"> ... is Amortentia! The most powerful love potion in the world. It’s
                rumored to smell differently to each person, according to what attracts them. For
                example, I smell freshly mown grass and new parchment and spearmint toothpaste
                    -<stage> Hermione blushes, stops herself. Slughorn regards her. </stage></sp>
            <sp who="#SLUGHORN"> One of my best friends is Muggle- born. She’s the best in our
                year... <stage> Harry, settling into his seat with the soiled textbook, looks up
                    just as Slughorn’s eyes shift to him for confirmation. As Harry nods, Hermione
                    glances curiously at him. </stage></sp>
            <sp who="#SLUGHORN"> Now Amortentia doesn’t create actual love, of course. That’s
                impossible. But it does cause a powerful infatuation or obsession. For that reason,
                it is probably the most dangerous potion in this room. <stage> Slughorn turns, finds
                    a sea of dreamy faces leaning into the VAPORS. Instantly, he CLANGS a cover onto
                    the cauldron, bringing them round. As Ron blinks, he finds Lavender still
                    staring dreamily -- at him. Noticing, Hermione’s eyes narrow. </stage></sp>
            <sp who="#KATIEBELL"> Sir, you haven’t told us what’s in that one. </sp>
            <sp who="#SLUGHORN"> Ah yes... <stage> Slughorn steps to a SMALL BLACK CAULDRON. Begins
                    to ladle a bit of GOLDEN LIQUID into a TINY VIAL. </stage></sp>
            <sp who="#SLUGHORN"> What you see before you, ladies and gentlemen, is a curious little

            <sp who="#HERMIONE"> Liquid luck. <stage> A buzz runs through the class. Even Malfoy
                    perks up. </stage></sp>
            <sp who="#SLUGHORN"> Yes, Miss Granger. Desperately tricky to make. Disastrous should
                you get it wrong. But brewed correctly, as this has been, it has remarkable powers.
                One sip and you will find that all your endeavors succeed... at least until the
                effects wear off. </sp>
            <sp who="#KATIEBELL"> But then why don’t people drink it all the time? </sp>
            <sp who="#SLUGHORN"> Because taken in excess it causes giddiness, recklessness and
                dangerous overconfidence. </sp>
            <sp who="#BLAISE"> Have you ever taken it, sir? </sp>
            <sp who="#SLUGHORN"> Twice. Once when I was twenty- four. Once when I was fifty- seven.
                Two tablespoons taken at breakfast. Two perfect days... <stage> Slughorn eyes the
                    vial dreamily, adrift. Finally he blinks. </stage></sp>
            <sp who="#SLUGHORN"> So. This is what I offer each of you today. One tiny vial of liquid
                luck... to the student who, in the hour that remains, manages to brew an acceptable
                Draught ofLiving Death, the recipe for which can be found on page ten of your
                textbook. <stage> Excitement seizes the class. Slughorn smiles knowingly.
                </stage></sp>
            <sp who="#SLUGHORN"> You should know that in all the years of my previous tenure at
                Hogwarts, not once did a student brew a potion of sufficient quality to claim this
                prize. In any event -- good luck. <stage> Slughorn sets the vial upon his desk,
                    where it SHIMMERS in a SHAFT of SUNLIGHT. Harry opens his book. Frowns. The
                    MARGINS of the page before him are black with the tight SCRIBBLINGS of a
                    previous owner. The same CREEPY GRAFFITI fills the next page as well, on and on
                    throughout the book. Shaking his head, Harry runs his finger under the first
                    PRINTED INSTRUCTION: “Cut up one Sopophorous bean.” Harry takes the SILVER
                    DAGGER upon his desk, poises it over the BEAN when... Ron’s bean shoots across
                    the room and bounces off Katie Bell’s head. Harry surveys the rest of the room:
                    everyone is struggling to cut the resistant legume. He glances back to his book,
                    considers the instruction again. As ARROW has been drawn from the word “Cut” to
                    the margin, where a modification has been written in the tight scrawl: “Crush
                    with blade -- releases juice better.” Harry considers the dagger in his hand,
                    then places the flat of the blade against the bean and presses. Instantly, the
                    protective parchment covering the desk runs RED with juice. </stage></sp>
            <sp who="#HERMIONE"> How did you do that? </sp>
            <sp who="#HARRY"> Crush it. Don’t cut it. </sp>
            <sp who="#HERMIONE"> No. The instructions specifically say to cut. </sp>
            <sp who="#HARRY"> No. Really - </sp>
            <sp who="#HERMIONE"> Sh! </sp>

            <stage>Harry shrugs, lifts the parchment and tips the juice into his cauldron. It
                HISSES, then turns LILAC. Harry grins. CAMERA BEGINS SLOW DOLLY TOWARDS the vial of
                Felix Felicis and... </stage>

                frustrated. Her hair grows bushier in the steam rising from her cauldron... Harry’s

                the margin... Malfoy cuts himself, curses... </stage>

            <stage>ANOTHER ANGLE Slughorn wends his way amongst the cauldrons, nodding with sympathy
                at the fiascos before him. Then... he stops, staring in disbelief at the pearly
                sheen of one bubbling potion. </stage>
            <sp who="#SLUGHORN"> Merlin’s Beard! But it’s perfect. So perfect I daresay one sip
                would kill us all! Your mother was a dab hand at potions, but this...My, my, what

                    first time, notices his hands. They are splayed, utterly still, andINTERLACED
                    with a SILKY WEB, where a SPIDER knits back and forth. </stage></sp>
            <sp who="#TOMRIDDLE"> You’re the doctor, aren’t you? </sp>
            <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE"> No. I am a Professor. </sp>
            <sp who="#TOMRIDDLE"> I don’t believe you. I hear Mrs. Cole talking, her and the rest of

            <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE"> Perhaps they’re right. </sp>
            <sp who="#TOMRIDDLE"> I’m not mad. </sp>
            <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE"> Hogwarts is not a place for mad people. <stage> Riddle looks up,

            <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE"> It’s a school. A school of... magic. <stage> Riddle stays
                    looking, but says nothing. </stage></sp>
            <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE"> You can do things, can’t you, Tom? Things the other children
                can’t. <stage> Riddle eyes Dumbledore intensely, unblinking. </stage></sp>
            <sp who="#TOMRIDDLE"> Yes. </sp>
            <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE"> Tell me some of the things you cando, Tom. </sp>

                    Dumbledore studies Riddle -- then the boy looks up. </stage></sp>

            <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE"> I’m like you, Tom. Different. <stage> Riddle closes his hands and
                    the web collapses. </stage></sp>
            <sp who="#TOMRIDDLE"> Prove it. <stage> It is not a request. Without breaking his gaze,
                    Dumbledore’s eyes narrow ever-so-slightly and... the WARDROBE BURSTS INTO
                    FLAMES. Riddle wheels. Slowly smiles. Dumbledore studies him. Abruptly, the
                    wardrobe begins to SHAKE. Riddle’s smile fades. </stage></sp>
            <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE"> I think there is something trying to get out of your wardrobe,
                Tom. Open it. Open. It. <stage> Terrified, Riddle steps to the burning wardrobe andt
                    hrows open the door. On the topmost shelf, above a rail of threadbare clothes, a
                    SMALL BOX SHAKES VIOLENTLY. </stage></sp>
            <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE"> Take it out. <stage> As Riddle’s fingers touch the box, the
                    flames engulfing the wardrobe vanish, but the box continues to SHAKE -- the only
                    sound in the now-silent room. </stage></sp>
            <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE"> Is there anything in that box you ought not to have? <stage>
                    Riddle eyes Dumbledore, a trifle fearfully this time. He spills the box onto the
                    bed: a YO-YO, a silver THIMBLE, and a tarnished MOUTH ORGAN. </stage></sp>
            <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE"> Why did you want these things, Tom? </sp>
            <sp who="#TOMRIDDLE">

            <sp who="#HARRY"> Thanks. All right. This morning I’ll be putting you all through a few
                drills to assess your strengths. But know this: Just because you made the team last
                year does not guarantee you a spot this year. Is that clear? <stage> Ron looks
                    unnerved at this, sweating so much he’s attracted a PESKY FLY. CORMAC McLAGGEN,
                    the huge boy from Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes, sidles up. </stage></sp>
            <sp who="#CORMAC"> No hard feelings, Weasley, alright? </sp>
            <sp who="#RON"> Hard feelings? </sp>

            <sp who="#RON"> Really? Strapping guy like you, you’ve got a Beater’s build, don’t you

            <sp who="#CORMAC"> I like my chances. Say... think you could introduce me to your friend
                Granger? Wouldn’t mind getting on a first name basis, know what I mean? <stage>
                    Cormac gives a lewd wink, saunters off. Ron glances up to the stands. Hermione
                    smiles, waves. </stage></sp>
            <stage>BEGIN MONTAGE Ginny flies swiftly, handling the Quaffle with ease. TWO SECOND
                YEARS collide in mid-air. Cormac makes a brilliant save. Ron makes a shaky save.
                Hermione looks on, nervous for him. Katie Bell snatches a Quaffle with one hand,
                splits two defenders beautifully and makes a slick blind pass to Dean who jets high
                in the air, then lets the Quaffle rolloff his fingers... right into Ginny’s hands as
                she races below. Seamus sends a Bludger rocketing into the stands, scatters a group
                of onlookers, leaving only Neville, who sidles delicately to the right as the others
                leg it. TWO THIRD YEARS collide in mid-air. Cormac makes a brilliant save. Ron turns
                the wrong way but makes the save anyway as the Quaffle caroms off the tail of his
                broom. Hermione looks on more nervously. DEMELZA ROBINS, bent low over her stick,
                pins the Quaffle under her chin, splits two Bludgers and a pair of Beaters. TWO
                FOURTH YEARS collide in mid-air. Two aspiring Beaters “whiff” on a pair of Bludgers,
                whack each other instead and plummet to the pitch as the Bludgers ricochet off one
                another and go flying into the stands, scattering onlookers yet again and leaving,
                as before, only Neville. This time, he sidles delicately to the left. Cormac makes a
                brilliant save. The Quaffle bounces off Ron’s head. Hermione looks on extremely
                nervously. TWO FIFTH YEARS collide in mid-air. END MONTAGE. </stage>

            <stage>ANOTHER ANGLE The survivors press ICE PACKS to their heads, run TAPE round
                twisted fingers. Only Ron, hovering at the west goal, and Cormac, hovering at the
                east, remain on the pitch. Luna, Spectrespecs in place, eyes Cormac -- cool,
                confident, clear. Then eyes Ron -- sweaty, nervous, SWARMING in WRACKSPURTS. </stage>
            <sp who="#HARRY"> All right. Cormac. Ron. It’s down to you two for Keeper. We’ll decide
                it with a shootout. Demelza, you’ll bring the Quaffle up against Cormac. Ginny,
                you’ll take on Ron. </sp>
            <sp who="#CORMAC"> Hang on. She’s his sister. How do I know she won’t toss him a

            <sp who="#HARRY"> Quiet! I’m Captain. We do it my way. Now line up. On three. One.
                Two... Three! <stage> Demelza and Ginny rocket forth. Ron weaves nervously while
                    Cormac hovers in place, a confident sneer on his face. </stage></sp>
            <sp who="#HARRY">
                <stage>under his breath</stage> C’mon, Ron... <stage> Demelza hunkers over her broom
                    once again, flying like a narrow, then goes into a wide, sweeping slide. Ginny
                    blasts over the pitch, ginger hair streaming like flames, then rolls recklessly
                    to the side. As one, they both let fly... Hermione, face buried in her fingers,
                    MUTTERS SOMETHING. Cormac, at the last moment, inexplicably rolls his broom to
                    the right and the Quaffle sails over his shoulder. Ron, zig-zagging crazily,
                    nearly falls off, rights himself in a panic, and deflects Ginny’s Quaffle...
                    with his forehead. As a few partisan CHEERS erupt from the stands, Harry grins,
                    then has to restrain himself. Hermione opens her eyes slowly. </stage></sp>
            <sp who="#LAVENDERBROWN"> Isn’t he brilliant? <stage> Hermione stares balefully at
                    Lavender, then notices Cormac eyeing his broom incredulously. She gets up, slips

                    starts to take the chair directly opposite Harry -- blocking his view.
                </stage></sp>
            <sp who="#HARRY"> No, no. Sit next to me. <stage> Ron stops, exchanges another glance
                    with Hermione. </stage></sp>
            <sp who="#RON"> O-kay. <stage> A SKINNY KID in an apron appears, tosses a FILTHY RAG
                    upon the table -- which begins to wipe the surface on its own. Harry cranes his
                    neck around the kid to keepSlughorn in view. </stage></sp>
            <sp who="#SKINNYKID"> What’ll we have? </sp>
            <sp who="#HERMIONE"> Three Butterbeers. Splash of ginger in mine, please. <stage> The
                    kid WHISTLES and the rag leaps back into his pocket. Harry continues to eye
                    Slughorn, when he sees Draco. They lock eyes briefly, then Draco exits.
                </stage></sp>
            <sp who="#RON"> Aw, bloody hell... <stage> Harry turns, sees Ron glowering at Ginny, who
                    sits in a dark corner with Dean, their faces lit by a guttering candle.
                </stage></sp>
            <sp who="#HERMIONE"> Oh, honestly, Ronald. They’re just holding hands... <stage>as Dean
                    kisses Ginny</stage> And snogging. </sp>
            <sp who="#RON"> I’d like to leave. </sp>
            <sp who="#HERMIONE"> Leave? You can’t be serious. </sp>
            <sp who="#RON"> That happens to be my sister. </sp>
            <sp who="#HERMIONE"> So? What if she looked over here and saw you snogging me? Would you
                expect her to get up and leave? <stage> Ron blinks, utterly speechless. Then:
                </stage></sp>
            <sp who="#SLUGHORN"> Harry, m’boy! <stage> Slughorn’s voice BOOMS so loudly even Ginny
                    jumps -- and catches Harry looking. As Slughorn waddles over, SLOSHING mug in
                    hand, Harry rises immediately -- an action so grossly out of character that
                    Hermione regards him with amused curiosity. </stage></sp>
            <sp who="#HARRY"> Hello, sir. Wonderful to see you. <stage> Hermione, brow wrinkling,
                    turns to Ron, silently mouths: wonderful to see you? </stage></sp>
            <sp who="#HARRY"> So what brings you here, sir? </sp>
            <sp who="#SLUGHORN"> Oh, the Three Broomsticks and I go way back. Longer than I’d care
                to admit. In fact, I remember when it was simply One Broomstick! <stage> As Slughorn
                    GUFFAWS, Harry joins in, LAUGHING HEARTILY as well. Slughorn’s belly trembles
                    next to Hermione’s cheek and his waving mug sloshes over, spattering the table.
                </stage></sp>
            <sp who="#SLUGHORN"> Oops! All hands on deck, Granger! <stage> Hermione smiles thinly,
                    when a WHISTLE is heard and the FILTHY RAG is back, whisking away Slughorn’s
                    mess as theSKINNY KID slides three foaming mugs onto the table. (In the b.g.
                    Katie Bell emerges from the back, starts for the exit. Her friend LEANNE follows
                    her out.) </stage></sp>
            <sp who="#SLUGHORN"> Listen, m’boy. In the old days, I used to throw together the
                occasional supper and invite a select student or two. Would you be game? </sp>
            <sp who="#HARRY"> I’d consider it an honor, sir. </sp>
            <sp who="#SLUGHORN"> You’d be welcome too, Granger. <stage> Hermione, in the midst of
                    emptying her Butterbeer in one long draw, SLAMS down her mug -- leaving behind
                    a“mustache.” </stage></sp>
            <sp who="#HERMIONE"> Be delighted, sir. </sp>
            <sp who="#SLUGHORN"> Brilliant. Look for my owl. (exiting, to Ron) Good to see you,
                Wallenby. <stage> Ron frowns as Slughorn waddles away, turns to Harry. </stage></sp>
            <sp who="#RON"> What’re you playing at? </sp>
            <sp who="#HARRY"> Dumbledore asked me to... get to know him. </sp>
            <sp who="#RON"> Get to know him? </sp>
            <sp who="#HARRY"> Dunno. But it must be important. Otherwise Dumbledore wouldn’t ask.
                    <stage> Slam! Ron turns, sees that Hermione has emptied his mug as well. Ron
                    gestures to her upper lip. </stage></sp>
            <sp who="#RON"> Um... You’ve got a little... <stage> Without a thought, she flicks her

                behind, pirouetting happily, letting snowflakes fall on her tongue. </stage>


            <sp who="#RON"> Bit worried about her. Did you hear that rubbish she was talking back in

                    ahead, Katie Bell and Leanne stand in the drifting snow, ARGUING. Katie holds a
                    SLENDER PACKAGE. Hermione comes bumping up, drapes her arms over the boys.

            <sp who="#HERMIONE"> What’s up? <stage>At that very instant, Katie Bell RISES SIX FEET
                    INTO THE AIR. Hair dancing violently in the wind, her face remains eerily
                    placid. Then she... SCREAMS. Harry and Ron DASH FORWARD, seize her ankles. At
                    their touch, she FALLS to the snow, THRASHING and SHRIEKING, EYES ROLLED UP in
                    her skull. </stage>

            <sp who="#LEANNE"> I warned her! I warned her not to touch it! <stage> Hermione looks.

            <sp who="#HAGRID"> Get back! All o’ yeh! <stage>He says this so forcefully the others
                    instantly obey. Effortlessly, he scoops up Katie’s thrashing body and then, as
                    if calming a terrified animal, presses his face close to hers and WHISPERS with
                    great TENDERNESS: </stage>

            <sp who="#HAGRID"> Now, now. Now, now... <stage>Over and over he repeats this,

                    goes limp. </stage>

                    nods darkly to the package in the snow. Harry kneels. Poking through the paper
                    is an ORNATE OPAL NECKLACE. Taking off his scarf he carefully enfolds package
                    and rises. Then, along with the others, he watches Hagrid lumber off, Katie
                    cradled in his arms. In seconds they are swallowed by the snow. The only sound
                    is the ROAR of the WIND. </stage>

            <sp who="#HARRY"> Did Voldemort ever make the shelf, sir? <stage> Slughorn stiffens, his

                    something. A few turn, snigger. Ron averts his eyes and... almost runs into
                    Cormac, who eyes him with disdain as he passes. Frowning, Ron drops down

                    Pitching herself into a wide slide to avoid a PAIR ofWHISTLING BLUDGERS, she
                    leans recklessly off her broom and whips the Quaffle through the goal untouched.

            <sp who="#HARRY"> I mean, I’m sure you’re tired of it, after all these years. The
                questions. About... Voldemort. <stage> Slughorn’s mixing hand falters instantly.
                </stage></sp>
            <sp who="#SLUGHORN"> I’ll ask you not to use that name. <stage> Slughorn’s stare is
                    fierce. Finally, he turns, goblet in hand, and puts a smile on his face, his
                    voice cheery. </stage></sp>
            <sp who="#HARRY"> Yes, sir. It’s just, well, Dumbledore once said that fear of a name
                only increases fear of the thing itself. It seemed sensible. </sp>
            <sp who="#SLUGHORN"> With all due respect, Dumbledore sometimes forgets that most of us
                do not possess powers so great that we can risk offending the most dangerous Dark
                Lord who ever lived. <stage> Slughorn’s stare is fierce, as fierce as the one
                    Dumbledore fixed Harry with. Finally, he turns away. </stage></sp>
            <sp who="#SLUGHORN"> Alright, m’boy! Bottoms up! </sp>
            <sp who="#RON"> What’s this? </sp>
            <sp who="#SLUGHORN"> A tonic for the nerves. <stage> Ron drinks. Beams briefly. Then his
                    grin sags. </stage></sp>
            <sp who="#RON"> What happened to me? </sp>
            <sp who="#HARRY"> Love potion. </sp>
            <sp who="#SLUGHORN"> And a bloody strong one at that. </sp>
            <sp who="#RON"> I feel really... bad. </sp>
            <sp who="#SLUGHORN"> Pick-me-up’s what you need, m’boy. <stage>eying Harry again</stage>
                Do us all good, I think. I’ve got butterbeer, wine -- ah -- and a dazzling
                oak-matured mead. I had other intentions for this but given the circumstances...
                    <stage> Slughorn takes a STOUT BOTTLE and fills a glass for Ron. As Ron SIPS,
                    Slughorn fills a pair for he and Harry. </stage></sp>
            <sp who="#SLUGHORN"> There we are, Potter. To life! <stage> CRASH! -- Ron’s glass hits
                    the floor and he crumples to his knees, then tumbles full out on the rug,
                    SPASMING horribly, FOAM oozing over his lips. Harry rushes to him. </stage></sp>
            <sp who="#HARRY"> Ron! Ron!!! Professor, help him! </sp>
            <sp who="#SLUGHORN"> I d-don’t understand - </sp>
            <sp who="#HARRY"> Professor! Do something!! <stage>Slughorn shuffles haplessly through
                    his bag, MUMBLING, at a loss. Harry turns back to Ron -- his skin is turning
                    BLUE. </stage>
            </sp>
            <sp who="#HARRY"> He’s choking!! <stage>Harry glances about, then leaps up, and
                    frantically begins to strip the walls of its potion stores, looking for
                    something, anything. A box tumbles, something spills: a scattering of stones, no
                    bigger than a robin’s egg, shriveled and dry. Snatching one, he wrenches open
                    Ron’s jaw and THRUSTS it deep into his THROAT. InstantlyRon stops moving,
                    paralyzed. The room is suddenly silent. He’s not breathing. Harry places both
                    hands behind Ron’s head and gives it a SHAKE. Another.</stage>
            </sp>
            <sp who="#HARRY"> Breathe! C’mon, Ron, don’t be a prat. Breathe! BREATHE! <stage>Harry
                    shakes him again and again... then stops. Ron’s head rolls limply from his
                    fingers. Slughorn looks on, mouth agape. Useless. Then... A COUGH, a great
                    hiccupping COUGH -- like a swimmer almost drowned -- and Ron is back. Breathing.
                </stage>
            </sp>
            <sp who="#RON"> These girls are gonna kill me, Harry. <stage>Harry grins. Then Ron’s

                stunned.</stage>


            <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE"> Quick thinking on your part, Harry. Using a Bezoar. You must be

            <sp who="#SLUGHORN"> Hm? Oh. Yes... very proud. </sp>
            <sp who="#MCGONAGALL"> I think we all agree that Mr. Potter’s actions were heroic. The
                question is: Why were they necessary. </sp>
            <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE"> Why indeed. <stage> Dumbledore takes the half-empty bottle of
                    mead, still bearing a bit of GIFTWRAP. </stage></sp>
            <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE"> This appears to be a gift, Horace. You don’t by chance remember
                who gave you this bottle, do you -- which by the way possesses remarkably subtle
                hints of licorice and cherry when not polluted with poison. </sp>
            <sp who="#SLUGHORN"> Actually I had intended to give it as a gift myself. </sp>
            <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE"> To whom might I ask? </sp>
            <sp who="#SLUGHORN"> You, Headmaster. <stage> Just then -- the DOOR BURSTS OPEN:
                    Lavender Brown. </stage></sp>

            <sp who="#LAVENDERBROWN"> Don’t make me laugh. You haven’t spoken in weeks. I suppose

            <sp who="#HERMIONE"> He’s been poisoned, you daft dimbo! And for the record, I’ve always
                found him interesting. <stage> Hermione frowns, a bit embarrassed. Ron SNORTS,
                    stirring. </stage></sp>
            <sp who="#LAVENDERBROWN"> Ha! See? He senses my presence. I’m here, Won-Won. I’m here - </sp>
            <sp who="#RON"> Er... My... Nee... Er! My! Nee! <stage> Ron, in a haze, reaches out
                    blindly. Blushing, Hermione takes his hand. Instantly, he falls unconscious
                    again. Lavender, vibrating with rage, stalks out. Dumbledore beams.
                </stage></sp>
            <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE"> Ah, to be young and feel love’s keen sting. Come, everyone, I
                think Mr. Weasley is well tended. <stage> As Dumbledore leads the others past Harry,
                    Harry studies him. Ginny passes, face very close, WHISPERING as she indicates
                    Ron and Hermione. </stage></sp>
            <sp who="#GINNY"> ‘Bout time, don’t you think? <stage> Harry watches her go, hopelessly

            <sp who="#SLUGHORN"> I’ve always cherished my students. They’re my life... <stage> Then
                    he is gone too. Harry turns back, studies Hermione, hand enfolded over Ron’s.
                    She looks up, sees his faint smile. </stage></sp>

                perusing the Half- Blood Prince’s Potion book, his eyes lingering, as before, over
                the SECTUMSEMPRA SPELL: “For Enemies.” Ron absently twirls his wand as he covertly
                eyes Lavender. Hermione frowns over the Prophet when... a snowflake falls upon her
                nose.</stage>


            <sp who="#HERMIONE"> Ron. Stop. You’re making it snow. </sp>
            <sp who="#RON"> Huh? <stage> Ron looks up, sees that it is SNOWING exclusively over the
                    trio. Hermione places her hand atop his wand and he blinks, as if the gesture
                    kindles some sense-memory. </stage></sp>
            <sp who="#RON"> Tell me again how I broke up withLavender? <stage> Harry pauses on his

                    Ron’s. </stage></sp>
            <sp who="#HERMIONE"> Um, well, she came to visit you in the hospital, you see, and you
                talked -- I don’t believe it was a long conversation - </sp>
            <sp who="#RON"> Don’t get me wrong. I’m bloody thrilled to be shot of her. It’s just she
                seems... a bit put out. <stage> As one, the three glance over at Lavender and are
                    rewarded with a lethal squint. </stage></sp>
            <sp who="#HERMIONE"> Does, doesn’t she? And you say you don’t remember a thing from that
                night? Not one thing? </sp>
            <sp who="#RON"> Well... there is... something. <stage>as Hermione hangs</stage> But no.
                It can’t be. Besides, I was completely boggled, wasn’t I? </sp>
            <sp who="#HERMIONE"> Right. Boggled... <stage> Hermione slumps back, frowning. Harry
                    smiles with amusement. Just then, a MILD COMMOTION draws his attention. At the
                    back of the Hall, a group of girls surrounds a new arrival. </stage></sp>
            <sp who="#HERMIONE"> That’s Katie. That’s Katie Bell. <stage> Katie Bell, pale but
                    smiling, greets the other girls. After a moment, she looks up. Finds Harry
                    standing before her. </stage></sp>
            <sp who="#HARRY"> How are you, Katie? </sp>
            <sp who="#KATIEBELL"> Give me a moment, girls. <stage> The girls drift off. Harry
                    watches them go, curious, then: </stage></sp>
            <sp who="#KATIEBELL"> I know you’re going to ask, Harry. But I don’t know who cursed me.
                I’ve tried to remember. Honestly. But I just... can’t... <stage> Katie’s eyes shift.
                    She goes ashen. Harry turns, follows her gaze and finds... Malfoy, staring at
                    her. Katie backs away, retreating to the other girls. Harry watches her go, then
                    looks back. Catches Malfoy fleeing the Hall. </stage></sp>

                CRY. In the MIRROR, we see the bathroom DOOR ease open: Harry. He stops, stunned.
                Malfoy’s eyes shift. Horrified to be exposed. He wheels, points his wand. WHOOSH!
                The LAMP next to Harry’s head SHATTERS. FLAMES spider up the ceiling. Harry draws
                his own wand, fires back. The CISTERN behind Malfoy EXPLODES and WATER sweeps the
                ceiling, rains down. Malfoy HOWLS with RAGE. Harry readies himself.</stage>

                    COLLAPSES. Harry glares at his wand in horror, then slushes across the floor,
                    the water running red with Malfoy’s blood. </stage></sp>
            <sp who="#MALFOY"> Don’t touch me! Don’t you dare touch me! Harry stops dead...
                transfixed by a FLASH of SOMETHING DARK pushing through the wet fabric of Malfoy’s
                shirtsleeve. Just then... Snape BURSTS THROUGH THE DOOR. Seeing Malfoy -- and the
                nature of his injuries -- he eyes Harry with keen curiosity. Kneeling, he traces
                theTIP of his WAND over Malfoy’s wounds, MURMURING an EERIE INCANTATION. Instantly,
                the skin begins to knit itself together. Harry backs away, Snape’s ancient CHANT
                ringing in his ears, blood floating like crimson flowers on the floor, backing away
                until he reaches the door... </sp>

                guard while Mrs. Norris sits calmly by. A MOUSE appears in the OPEN helmet of a SUIT
                OF ARMOR, washes its face with its tiny paws, then spiesMrs. Norris -- who HISSES.
                The mouse makes a quick retreat and the FACE PLATE comes CLANGING down. As Filch

            <stage> GROUNDS/HOGWARTS CASTLE - DUSK (MOMENTS LATER) TWO AURORS, twin SILHOUETTES,
                patrol the grounds. Harry approaches, about to intersect their paths when, at the
                last second, something on the ground catches his eye. He KNEELS, considers a BEETLE
                on its back, legs churning helplessly. Harry extends his finger, letting the tiny
                bug gain purchase, then tips it upright... ...just as the Aurors’ SHADOWS quiver
                over him and vanish. Rising, Harry starts off in one direction, then stops, as if
                compelled by some inner voice, and heads the opposite way. </stage>

                ahead, a FIGURE ripples beyond the steamy panes of the Greenhouse. It’s Slughorn,
                hunched over a PLANT whose TENDRILS coil eerily, resisting his attentions. Snip! He
                stealthily removes a sprig, looks up and JUMPS. </stage>

            <sp who="#SLUGHORN"> Merlin’s beard, Harry! </sp>
            <sp who="#HARRY"> Sorry, sir. I should’ve announced myself. Cleared my throat. Coughed.
                You probably feared I was Madam Sprout. </sp>
            <sp who="#SLUGHORN"> Well, yes, actually - <stage>paranoid</stage> Why would you think
                that? </sp>
            <sp who="#HARRY"> Just the general behavior, sir. The sneaking around. The jumping when
                you saw me. By the way, those Tentacula leaves -- they’re quite valuable, aren’t
                they? </sp>
            <sp who="#SLUGHORN"> Ten galleons a leaf to the right buyer -- not that I’m familiar
                with such back alley transactions. One hears rumors is all. My own interests are
                purely academic, of course. </sp>

                    <stage>Harry gives a little SHIVER of the shoulders, smiles. Slughorn cocks his

            <sp who="#SLUGHORN"> Exactly how did you get out of the castle, Harry? </sp>
            <sp who="#HARRY"> Through the front doors, sir. I’m off to Hagrid’s, you see. He’s a
                very dear friend and I felt like paying him a visit. So if you don’t mind, I’ll be

                    with his hand, while making a CLICKING sound. Hagrid eyes Harry curiously.

            <sp who="#HARRY"> Through the front doors. </sp>
            <sp who="#SLUGHORN"> Hagrid. I wouldn’t want to be indelicate, but Acromantula venom is
                uncommonly rare and, well, if you wouldn’t mind my extracting a vial or two --
                purely for academic pursuits... </sp>
            <sp who="#HAGRID"> Don’ suppose it’s doin’ ‘im any good, izzit? </sp>
            <sp who="#SLUGHORN"> My thoughts exactly! Always carry a few spare ampoules for just
                such occasions. Old Potion Master’s habit, you know... <stage> Slughorn rummages
                    about his pockets, extracts some SMALL VIALS -- all empty save for one
                    containing a HAIRY WORM -- then scrambles up close to Aragog. Harry and Hagrid
                    watch. </stage></sp>

                magnificent... <stage> Hagrid BLINKS wildly, then takes out a handkerchief and
                    SNORTS LOUDLY into it. Slughorn looks up, studies Hagrid’s sorry expression with
                    empathy and steps away. </stage></sp>
            <sp who="#SLUGHORN"> Why don’t I say a few words? I trust he had family? </sp>

            <stage> HAGRID’S HUT - NIGHT (HOURS LATER) Harry, Hagrid and Slughorn sit at the massive
                kitchen table, which is strewn with EMPTY WINE BOTTLES. Hagrid and Slughorn are
                feeling no pain, while Harry looks clear- eyed, focused. </stage>
            <sp who="#HAGRID #SLUGHORN "> To the place he’d known as a lad, They laid him to rest
                with his hat inside out and his wand snapped in two, which was sad... <stage> As
                    they finish, both men CHUCKLE. Hagrid tops off everyone’s mug with a bit more
                    wine. Harry brings his mug to his lap... then slyly pours it into the bucket at
                    his feet. </stage></sp>
            <sp who="#HAGRID"> I had ‘im from an egg, yeh know. Tiny little thing he was when he

            <sp who="#SLUGHORN"> Sweet. I once had a fish. Francis. Lovely little thing. One day I

                    ceiling. </stage></sp>
            <sp who="#SLUGHORN"> That’s never unicorn hair, Hagrid? <stage> Hagrid looks up, reels a
                    bit. Nods. </stage></sp>
            <sp who="#SLUGHORN"> But my dear chap, do you know how much that’s worth? </sp>
            <sp who="#HAGRID"> No idea... no idea at all... <stage> Thunk! Hagrid’s great shaggy
                    head hits the table. Instantly, he is SNORING, so DEEPLY his MUG shimmies across
                    the table. Slughorn smiles, regards Harry, who merely stares back. Slughorn
                    averts his eyes. Suddenly nervous. A WIND rises outside. Windowpanes rattle.
                </stage></sp>
            <sp who="#SLUGHORN"> It was a student who gave me Francis. One spring afternoon I
                discovered a bowl upon my desk with a few inches of clear water. There was a flower
                petal floating upon the surface. As I watched, the petal sank, but just before it
                touched bottom... it transformed. Into a wee fish. It was beautiful magic, wondrous
                to behold. The petal had come from a lily. <stage> Hearing “lily,” Harry looks up.
                    Slughorn nods. </stage></sp>
            <sp who="#SLUGHORN"> Your mother. The day I came downstairs, the day I found the bowl
                empty... was the day she... <stage> Slughorn falters, pain etching his face.
                </stage></sp>
            <sp who="#SLUGHORN"> I know what you want. But I can’t give it to you. It will ruin
                me... <stage> Harry studies Slughorn a moment, thinking, then speaks. </stage></sp>
            <sp who="#HARRY"> Do you know why I survived? The night I got this. <stage> Slughorn
                    looks up, sees Harry pointing to his scar. </stage></sp>
            <sp who="#HARRY"> Because of her. Because she sacrificed herself. Because she refused to
                step aside. Because her love was more powerful than Voldemort. </sp>
            <sp who="#SLUGHORN"> Please don’t say his - </sp>
            <sp who="#HARRY"> I’m not afraid of the name, Professor. And I’m not afraid of him. And
                you shouldn’t be either. She didn’t just die for me that night. She died for you
                too. She died for everyone who’s ever woken in the middle of the night afraid a
                Death Eater waited on their doorstep. <stage> Slughorn gazes into the guttering
                    candle before him. </stage></sp>
            <sp who="#HARRY"> Professor. I’m going to tell you something, something others have only
                guessed at. It’s true. I am the Chosen One. <stage> Slughorn looks up. Harry nods.
                </stage></sp>
            <sp who="#HARRY"> Only I can kill him. But in order to do so, I need to know what Tom
                Riddle asked you that night in your office all those years ago. And I need to know
                what you told him. <stage> Slughorn’s eyes well with tears, his hands tremble.
                </stage></sp>
            <sp who="#HARRY"> Be brave, Professor. Be brave like my mother. Otherwise you disgrace
                her. Otherwise she died for nothing. Otherwise, the bowl remains empty forever.
                    <stage> Slughorn shakes his head, staring into the candle. Finally, slowly, he
                    removes his wand. </stage></sp>
            <sp who="#SLUGHORN"> Don’t think too badly of me once you’ve seen it. You don’t know
                what he was like... even then. <stage>Slughorn fishes out a tiny vial -- the one
                    with the WORM-- but his hand is shaking so violently, Harry has to take it.
                    Slowly, Slughorn raises his wand, touches it to his temple and withdraws a LONG,
                    SILVER THREAD. Harry extends the vial and... it drops within. </stage>

                    Tom Riddle’s drawings seen at the orphanage, of the CAVE and the distinct
                    OUTCROPPING. Then... the pearl drops. </stage>

                m’boy, I’d like to know where you get your information. More knowledgable than half
                the staff, you are. <stage>as the other boys laugh</stage> By the way, thank you for

                forget your essays... <stage> The others exit, when -- PING! -- Slughorn turns, eyes
                    the hourglass, finds Tom Riddle still there. </stage></sp>
            <sp who="#SLUGHORN"> Look sharp, Tom. You don’t want to be caught out of bed after
                hours... </sp>
            <sp who="#TOMRIDDLE"> I know a secret shortcut or two. </sp>
            <sp who="#SLUGHORN"> Yes, I imagine you do. Something on your mind, Tom? </sp>
            <sp who="#TOMRIDDLE"> Yes, sir. I couldn’t think of anyone else to go to. The other
                Professors, well, they’re not like you. They might... misunderstand. </sp>
            <sp who="#SLUGHORN"> Go on. </sp>
            <sp who="#TOMRIDDLE"> I was in the library the other night, in the Restricted section,
                and I read something rather odd, about a bit of rare magic and I thought perhaps you
                could illuminate me. It’s called, as I understand it... a Horcrux. <stage>
                    Slughorn’s weak smile evaporates altogether. </stage></sp>
            <sp who="#SLUGHORN"> Excuse me? </sp>
            <sp who="#TOMRIDDLE"> Horcrux. I came across the term while reading and I didn’t fully
                understand it. </sp>
            <sp who="#SLUGHORN"> I’m not sure what you were reading, Tom, but that’s very Dark
                stuff, very Dark indeed. </sp>
            <sp who="#TOMRIDDLE"> Yes, sir. Which is why I came to you. I mean no disrespect to the
                rest of the staff, but I thought if anyone could tell me... it would be you. <stage>
                    Slughorn frowns, clearly disturbed, then speaks quietly. </stage></sp>
            <sp who="#SLUGHORN"> A Horcrux is an object in which a person has concealed part of
                their soul. </sp>
            <sp who="#TOMRIDDLE"> Yes, I thought it might be something like that. But I don’t
                understand how that works, sir. </sp>
            <sp who="#SLUGHORN"> One splits one’s soul and hides part of it in an object. By doing
                so, you are protected should you be attacked and your body destroyed. </sp>
            <sp who="#TOMRIDDLE"> Protected? </sp>
            <sp who="#SLUGHORN"> That part of your soul that was hidden, lives on. In other words,
                you cannot die. <stage> Riddle nods and TURNS AWAY, staring at himself in the MIRROR
                    on the wall opposite. A hint of RED glints in his eyes. </stage></sp>
            <sp who="#TOMRIDDLE"> How does one split his soul, sir? </sp>
            <sp who="#SLUGHORN"> I think you can guess the answer to that, Tom. </sp>
            <sp who="#TOMRIDDLE"> Murder. </sp>
            <sp who="#SLUGHORN"> Yes. Killing rips the soul apart. It is a violation against nature.
                After, one is never the same. </sp>
            <sp who="#TOMRIDDLE"> Out of curiosity, sir -- can you only split your soul once? For
                instance, isn’t seven the most powerfully magical number - </sp>
            <sp who="#SLUGHORN"> Seven! Merlin’s beard, Tom! Isn’t it bad enough to think of killing
                one person? To rip the soul into seven pieces... <stage>stopping; worried</stage>
                This is all hypothetical, isn’t it, Tom? All academic... </sp>
            <sp who="#TOMRIDDLE"> Of course, sir. And I promise I’ll not speak of our conversation.
                It’ll be our little secret... <stage> Riddle reaches out then and pinches the FLAME

                    Dumbledore looks off, his eyes distant. Harry watches him intently, as do the
                    HEADMASTERS in their frames above. Finally, tentatively, Harry speaks.

                us. </sp>
            <sp who="#HARRY"> Seven. He made seven -- the most powerfully magical number. But...

            <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE"> They can be anything. The most commonplace of objects. A ring,

                    and Tom Riddle’s battered DIARY. </stage></sp>
            <sp who="#HARRY"> Tom Riddle’s diary - </sp>
            <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE"> It’s a Horcrux, yes. Four years ago, when you saved Ginny

                    up the diary</stage> I knew. This was a different kind of magic. Very dark. Very

            <sp who="#HARRY"> And the ring...? </sp>
            <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE"> Belonged to Voldemort’s mother. It was difficult to find and...

                    DIZZYING succession: VOLDEMORT’S FACE, twisted in pain. A DERELICT HOUSE, deep
                    in a haunted clearing. An ANCIENT CUP, gleaming as it tumbles from an old
                    woman’s hand. A SNAKE (NAGINI) slithering through damp grass. Dumbledore
                    slipping the ring onto his finger, recoiling as his skin decays... </stage></sp>
            <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE"> ... leaves traces. <stage> Harry’s clenched hand SPASMS,
                    RELEASES. The ring skitters across Dumbledore’s desk and Harry brings a hand to
                    his chest, a look of bewilderment on his face. Dumbledore watches the ring spin
                    down, then glances at Harry and slowly extends his own hand, lightly touching
                    the center of Harry’s chest with the tips of ashen fingers, as if reading
                    braille, as if he can somehow “see” into Harry’s heart. Trepidation -- and

                    when it comes, distant. </stage></sp>
            <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE"> Yes. And I think... perhaps... I may have found another. But this

                    is descending the stairs. Seeing Harry, Snape falters briefly, then continues on
                    without a word. As his FOOTSTEPS fade, Harry ascends to the upper tier.

                    he leaps to the basin. A GOLDEN LOCKET now lies at the bottom. Harry snatches it
                    up. </stage></sp>
            <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE"> Water... </sp>

            <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE"> Water! <stage> Harry dips the goblet into the basin yet again,
                    brings it to Dumbledore’s lips... but once again finds it empty. Dumbledore
                    tries to speak, but his lips are CRACKING, his tongue like SAND. He GULPS DRILY
                    for air. </stage></sp>

                    the SOFT LAPPING of the lake. He considers the GHOSTLY SHAPES gliding just below
                    the surface. Deciding, he dips the goblet into the dark water. Instantly, the
                    lake begins to CHURN. Harry backs away, the goblet sloshing in his hand. FACES,
                    pale and haunted, quiver in the roiling water. Harry tips the water into
                    Dumbledore’s mouth. Dumbledore blinks. His tongue probes his lower lip. Harry
                    returns to the water’s edge, hesitates, then plunges the goblet into water once
                    more. Instantly, a SLIMY WHITE HAND snags his wrist and Harry is pulled under.
                    The goblet bobs on the surface. </stage></sp>
            <stage>NEW ANGLE - UNDERWATER Utterly silent. Harry twists madly as HANDS reach for him,
                turning him this way and that. HAUNTED FACES float by. </stage>
            <stage>NEW ANGLE - THE SURFACE Harry breaks the surface, GASPING for air, blinking,
                catching a glimpse of Dumbledore slumped against the basin as he is... </stage>
            <stage>NEW ANGLE - UNDERWATER ... pulled underwater once again, into the eerie SILENCE
                of flailing arms. He shakes free again and again, but there are too many hands, too
                many haunted faces. We STAY UNDER a very long time, feel his lungs burning. His eyes
                lose their focus, turning blank. Bubbles trail out of his mouth as his face goes
                slack. He sinks deeper, in free fall, takes one last look at the SHIMMERING SURFACE
                ABOVE, the last thing he will see... when a SHADOW SHIVERS briefly and... ... the
                SURFACE SIZZLES with RED LIGHT, like blood, then becomes TRANSPARENT, revealing
                DUMBLEDORE, wand pointed directly at the water. </stage>
            <stage>NEW ANGLE - THE SURFACE Harry breaks the surface, SPITTING UP WATER, GASPING
                FORAIR. Dumbledore staggers, slumps once more against the basin, weakened by his
                effort. Harry scrambles up, steadies him and the lake EXPLODES WITH FIRE. Harry
                wheels, watches the bodies in the lake twist in pain. </stage>
            <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE"> Go... <stage>Harry turns, confused. Dumbledore’s hand finds his

                    open the door, when FOOTSTEPS sound. Draws his wand. Dumbledore cocks his head,
                    listening. Wincing, he straightens up, as if to mask his infirmity.

                </stage></sp>
            <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE"> Good evening, Draco. What brings you out on such a fine Spring

                    about. </stage></sp>
            <sp who="#MALFOY"> Who else is here? I heard you talking. </sp>
            <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE"> I often talk aloud to myself. I find it extraordinarily useful.
                That which sounds sane at a whisper can seem utterly mad when said for all the world
                to hear. Haven’t been whispering to yourself, have you, Draco? <stage> Draco eyes
                    Dumbledore with unease. </stage></sp>
            <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE"> You are not an assassin, Draco. </sp>
            <sp who="#MALFOY"> How do you know what I am? I’ve done things that would shock you. </sp>
            <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE"> Like cursing Katie Bell and hoping she would, in turn, bear a
                cursed necklace to me? Like replacing a bottle of mead with one laced with poison.
                Forgive me, Draco, but these are attempts so feeble I cannot help but question if
                your heart has been really in them. I’m curious. When Voldemort gave you this task,
                when he asked you to kill me, was it in a whisper? </sp>
            <sp who="#MALFOY"> He trusts me! I was chosen! <stage> Malfoy thrusts out his arm, pulls
                    back his sleeve and reveals the DARK MARK. Dumbledore barely looks at it.
                </stage></sp>
            <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE"> Then I shall make it easy for you. <stage> Slowly and without
                    intent, Dumbledore draws his wand. Instantly Malfoy raises his own.
                </stage></sp>
            <sp who="#MALFOY"> Expelliarumus! <stage> Harry watches in horror as Dumbledore’s wand
                    flies free, clattering across the grid above. Malfoy watches it roll to a stop,
                    a curious mixture of fear and awe at his own actions. Dumbledore eyes the wand,
                    then Draco. </stage></sp>
            <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE"> Well done, Draco. But I warn you. Killing is not nearly as easy.
                    <stage> Malfoy looks into Dumbledore’s eyes, then to the sky, at the gathering
                    clouds, twisting darkly, then glances to the stairwell. Dumbledore notices.

            <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE"> You’re not alone. Are you. There are others. How? <stage> A
                    sneering smile plays over Malfoy’s lips. </stage></sp>
            <sp who="#MALFOY"> The Vanishing Cabinet in the Room of Requirement. </sp>
            <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE"> That cabinet has been broken for years. </sp>

                knew a boy years ago who made all the wrong choices. Let me help you, Draco. </sp>
            <sp who="#MALFOY"> I don’t want your help! Don’t you see! I have to do it! I have to!
                    <stage>in a whisper</stage> I’ve got to kill you or he’ll kill me. </sp>
            <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE"> Say that again, Draco. But aloud this time. <stage> Draco looks
                    deep into Dumbledore’s eyes. His hand trembles. Transfixed, Harry watches from
                    the shadows. Slowly, Malfoy begins to LOWER HIS WAND... when FOOTSTEPS ECHO. The
                    DOOR FLIES OPEN: Bellatrix, Greyback and the others. </stage></sp>
            <sp who="#BELLATRIX"> Well now, look what we have here. Dumbledore. Wandless and alone.
                Cornered in his own castle. Well done, Draco. <stage> Harry peers up, eyes flashing
                    angrily at the sound of Bellatrix’s voice. He draws his wand slowly.
                </stage></sp>
            <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE"> Good evening, Bellatrix. I think introductions are in order. </sp>
            <sp who="#BELLATRIX"> Love to, Albus. But I’m afraid we’re on a bit of a tight schedule.
                    <stage>(to Malfoy)</stage> Do it. <stage>Malfoy’s wand rises once again. Harry
                    raises his own, aiming through the grid, poised. Just then, a SHADOW splinters
                    through the columns to his right. He looks, finds Snape, quiet as a ghost,
                    peering upward. Carefully, Snape draws his wand, then turns to Harry, a finger
                    to his lips: Shhh. Then he is drifting upward. Silent. A ghost again. </stage>
            </sp>
            <sp who="#GREYBACK"> He doesn’t have the stomach. Like his father. Let me finish him. In

            <sp who="#BELLATRIX"> No! The Dark Lord was clear. The boy’s to do it. Go on, Draco.
                Now! <stage> Once again Draco raises his wand, his hand trembling. Harry’s own arm
                    is stiff, sure. The vein in his hand pulsates... </stage></sp>

            <sp who="#SNAPE"> I gave my word. I made a vow... <stage> Harry’s eyes dart back and
                    forth frantically, trying to make sense of the scene playing out above. Snape’s
                    arm rises. </stage></sp>
            <sp who="#SNAPE"> Avada Kedavra! <stage> A JET of GREEN LIGHT hits Dumbledore squarely
                    in the chest. For a second he hangs, suspended upon the ramparts, and then...
                    the night swallows him. HARRY SCREAMS in RAGE. Bellatrix raises her wand to the
                    sky and a DEAFENING BLAST shakes the castle, maskingHarry’s cry. The CLOUDS
                    EXPLODE with GRIM LIGHT, mutating into a SKULL. As the Death Eaters flee,
                    Snape’s arm drops limply to his side. </stage></sp>

                    empty place where Dumbledore stood only seconds before. Snape takes him by the
                    scruff of the neck, forces him through the door, then follows. Harry scrambles
                    up the stairs and lurches to the ramparts, BATHED IN THE GREEN LIGHT from above.
                    He peers down. Agony wrecks Harry’s face and he has to steady himself. He looks

            <stage> HAGRID’S HUT/GROUNDS - SAME TIME - NIGHT Quiet here. A VIEW TOWARD the castle.
                We HOLD. Slowly FIGURES appear on the horizon. The Death Eaters. Greyback.
                Bellatrix, Draco. And Snape. </stage>

        <scene>
            <stage cat="EXT" where=" HOGWARTS CASTLE - NIGHT"> Harry bursts through the entrance
                doors, wand in hand. Before him, the grounds shimmer eerily in the GREEN GLOW. He
                sees the FIGURES FLEEING towards Hagrid’s Hut. </stage>
        </scene>
        <scene>
            <stage cat="EXT" where="HAGRID’S HUT / GROUNDS - SAME TIME - NIGHT"> Snape and the
                others race toward the edge of the grounds. Suddenly, Snape pulls up, looks back.
                Sees Harry sprinting toward him. Malfoy, looking edgy, is watching Harry too. </stage>


            <sp who="#SNAPE"> Go on! <stage> Just then a GIANT FIREBALL erupts into the sky. Snape
                    wheels, sees Bellatrix and the others silhouetted against the flames. They’ve
                    set Hagrid’s Hut ablaze. Malfoy stands paralyzed. </stage></sp>
            <sp who="#SNAPE"> Go on! </sp>
            <stage>NEW ANGLE - HARRY Running. Harry bolts forth, wand in hand, vengeance in his
                eyes. Up ahead, Snape stands stolidly, tall and black against the raging fire. Harry
                points his wand, fires a JET of RED LIGHT. Snape doesn’t move, merely lets it streak
                by his head. Harry stops, chest heaving, and takes aim again. </stage>
            <sp who="#HARRY"> Cruciatus! <stage>Snape raises his wand, parries the curse with ease.
                </stage>
            </sp>
            <sp who="#HARRY"> Incacerata! <stage>Once again, Snape deflects the spell.</stage>
            </sp>
            <sp who="#HARRY"> Impedimenta! <stage>Another lazy flick of the arm, another curse
                    defeated. Harry drops his arm in frustration. </stage>
            </sp>
            <sp who="#HARRY"> Fight! Fight back, you coward! <stage>With staggering quickness,
                    Snape’s wand whips forth and Harry is off his heels and crashing to the earth.
                </stage>
            </sp>
            <sp who="#SNAPE"> Don’t ever associate that word and my name again. <stage>Harry raises
                    himself up on one knee, points his wand when... a JET of RED LIGHT sends him
                    crashing back into the grass. Snape wheels, sees Bellatrix standing behind.
                </stage>
            </sp>
            <sp who="#SNAPE"> No! He belongs to the Dark Lord! <stage>Bellatrix eyes Snape levelly,
                    then turns, trots off. Snape glances at Harry, then turns away himself, walking.
                    Harry grimaces, pulls himself to his feet and aims one last time. </stage>
            </sp>
            <sp who="#HARRY"> Sectumsempra! <stage>Bang! Snape wheels and once more sends Harry
                    flying onto his back. Harry stares at the stars as they wheel over him, when
                    Snape comes INTO VIEW. </stage>
            </sp>
            <sp who="#SNAPE"> You dare use my own spells against me, Potter? <stage> Harry goes
                    still. His eyes shift, meet Snape’s. </stage></sp>
            <sp who="#SNAPE"> You may have gotten your mother’s eyes, but you’re as dim as your
                father. Yes. It’s me. I’m the Half-Blood Prince. <stage>Snape kicks Harry’s wand
                    aside and turns away, joining Malfoy and the others where they wait beyond the
                    flaming ruins of Hagrid’s Hut. They head for the darkness of the treeline. And
                    VANISH. Harry pounds his fist into the ground, then stops. </stage>
            </sp>
            <sp who="#HARRY"> Hagrid... HAGRID! <stage>Harry races toward the hut when the DOOR
                    flies off its hinges. Seconds later, Hagrid stumbles out, beard SMOKING.

                    <stage>Hagrid turns then, sees the HUGE THRONG of STUDENTS and STAFF assembled
                    outside the castle. </stage>
            </sp>

                    <stage>Harry tries to speak, but he is mute. Hagrid goes still. </stage>

        </scene>
        <scene>
            <stage cat="EXT" where=" HOGWARTS CASTLE - MIDDLE COURTYARD - NIGHT"> Ron, Hermione and
                Ginny stand with the staff. They turn and watch the throng of students part for
                Harry and Hagrid. Hagrid stops short, shattered by what he sees. Harry pushes on,
                kneels. Dumbledore’s eyes are closed, his face peaceful. Harry straightens his
                half-moon spectacles, wipes a trickle of blood from his mouth. Runs the back of his
                hand, gently, over the weathered cheek. Then he notices something lying beside
                Dumbledore’s ashen hand: the locket. He takes it, considers it numbly. Then begins
                to cry, great shudders of grief wracking his body. Hermione gives Ginny a nudge and
                she steps forward, drops beside him. At her touch, his head falls on her shoulder
                and she begins to stroke him. Ron looks on. Understands all. McGonagall lifts a
                trembling wand to the sky and slowly the TIP GLOWS to life. One after another,
                students and staff do the same, lifting their wands in salute. As CAMERA RISES, the
                pinpricks coalesce into one BLAZING FIRE. The sky, briefly emerald, turns black once
                more. The Dark Mark vanishes. </stage>

            <stage> DUMBLEDORE’S OFFICE - DAY Quiet. Still. Empty. Then: The door eases OPEN and
                Harry enters. For a moment, he simply stands staring. Taking inventory. Spying
                something, he crosses to the great desk opposite. Looks down. Dumbledore’s wand.
                Reaching out, Harry takes it in hand. Old, oft-used and bearing the impression of
                its owner’s fingers, it is a strangely beautiful object. Harry traces his thumb
                lightly over the wood, transfixed, when... ... McGonagall enters. Potter. </stage>
            <sp who="#MCGONAGALL"><stage> He doesn’t respond, lost in the wand. McGonagall’s eyes
                    drift to it, briefly, then study Harry’s face. She frowns, trying to call forth
                    some words. </stage></sp>
            <sp who="#MCGONAGALL"> Potter, in light of what’s happened... should you feel the need
                to talk to someone... <stage> She falters. Harry gently sets the wand back upon the
                    desk, retraces his steps to the door, pauses for one last look. </stage></sp>
            <sp who="#MCGONAGALL"> You should know... Professor Dumbledore... <stage>Harry turns
                    then, studying her drawn face, no words necessary. At a loss, she finishes
                    quietly: </stage>
            </sp>
            <sp who="#MCGONAGALL"> You meant a great deal to him. <stage>Harry’s eyes rise. High
                    upon the wall, the past Headmasters snooze in their frames. The last looks
                    remarkably peaceful, the trace of a smile on his lips as he sleeps. Dumbledore.
                    Harry nods, lingering one last moment, and exits. </stage>

                    <stage>Harry just stares at her. She cocks her head, smiling, doing her best to
                    coax one out of him. Finally, he does, briefly.</stage>
            </sp>
            <sp who="#HARRY"> Yeah. I do. But do me a favor. When I’m around? Keep the snogging to a

            <sp who="#HERMIONE"> Like that’s going to happen. <stage>She glances at Ron, shakes her

            <sp who="#HERMIONE"> Besides, he’s barking. </sp>
            <sp who="#HARRY"> Funny, he says the same about you. </sp>
            <sp who="#HERMIONE"> Yes, but I’m exceptionally perceptive. </sp>
            <sp who="#HARRY"> You’re brilliant. You both are. <stage>Harry looks off again and
                    Hermione follows his gaze. She looks out over the grounds. Slowly losing
                    herself. We can tell. She’s taking inventory. Pressing it into a scrapbook.

            </sp>
            <sp who="#HERMIONE"> Do you think we’ll ever... (comeback?) <stage>She stops. Her eyes
                    glisten briefly. Then she fights it back. Tough. Harry fights back his own
                    emotion, reaches over and gives her hand a brief squeeze. Then releases her.
                </stage>

            <sp who="#HARRY"> I don’t know. <stage>Hermione nods and Harry’s eyes shift, consider
                    Ron andGinny. As if sensing his gaze, Ron turns and they exchange a look,
                    something unspoken but true passing between them. Just then a SONG rises on the
                    air, mournful and haunting, and seconds later a BIRD soars out from beyond the
                    tallest turret and begins to stitch its way across the sky. Ron and Ginny cross
                    to Harry and Hermione, lean against the rampart. All look to the horizon,
                    watching the bird grow smaller while its song -- magically -- endures. No one
                    says a word. </stage>
