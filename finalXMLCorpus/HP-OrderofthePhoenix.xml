         <stage>FADE IN </stage>
         <stage cat="EXT" where="LITTLE  WHINGING  -  NIGHT"> It is sunset. We drift through the
            clouds, approaching NUMBER FOUR, PRIVET DRIVE. We sail over the roof of NUMBER FOUR and
            continue on past it into the street. We drift down into an abandoned playground. A lone
            figure sits on the only unbroken swing.. It is HARRY POTTER. He appears deep in thought.
            Had he been watching more carefully, he would have seen the old MRS. FIGG watching him
            from her front porch. </stage>
         <stage>MRS. FIGG adjusts her porch chair in order to watch Harry better. The sound of harsh
            laughter reaches Harry's ears. He looks up. Dudley and his gang of followers are walking
            down the street, telling crude jokes and laughing. They ignore Harry and continue on out
            of sight. Harry gets to his feet and follows them. </stage>
      </scene>
      <scene>
         <stage cat="EXT" where="STREET  -  NIGHT"> Harry rounds the corner, only to find himself
            surrounded by Dudley's gang. </stage>
         <sp who="#DUDLEY">Oh, it's you. </sp>
         <sp who="#GANGTHUG1"> What should we do with him, Big D? Harry laughs. </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">Big D? Cool name, but to me, you'll always be Ikkle Duddicums. </sp>
         <sp who="#DUDLEY">Shut up!<stage> One of Dudley's gang steps in as if to punch Harry. Harry
               glares at him. The gang member pauses, then steps back again. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#DUDLEY">Ooo, tough guy. Not so tough in your bed, are you? </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">What? </sp>
         <stage>MRS. FIGG stands up and goes to the edge of her porch. </stage>
         <sp who="#MRSFIGG">You boys go home now, or I'll be calling your parents! They pause and
            edge away from Harry. </sp>
         <sp who="#DUDLEY">I heard you talking in your sleep, last night. Crying. "No, don't kill
            Cedric, don't kill Cedric! Dad, help me, heeelp me! He's going to kill me! Boo-hoo!"
            Dudley's gang laughs. </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">Shut up, Dudley. I'm warning you... </sp>
         <sp who="#DUDLEY">Why should I? Harry whips out his wand and points it at Dudley. </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">Because if you don't I'll turn you into the idiot pig you are!<stage>
               Dudley's gang laughs at Harry. Dudley, on the other hand, is terrified. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#DUDLEY"><stage>terrified</stage> Don't point that thing at me! </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">Not so brave now, are you Duddykins? Now tell your little friends to go
            away. Dudley quivers, then finally complies. </sp>
         <sp who="#DUDLEY"> G-go home!<stage> What? </stage></sp>
         <stage>GANG MEMBER #3 </stage>
         <sp who="#DUDLEY">Get out of here!<stage> Suddenly nervous, they turn and edge away, soon
               vanishing into the night. Harry tightened his grip on his wand, glaring fourteen
               years of hatred and rage at Dudley. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY"><stage>cont.</stage> Don't you ever speak about that again. You
            understand? </sp>
         <sp who="#DUDLEY">Don't point that thing at me! </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">I SAID, DO YOU UNDERS'IAND?!<stage> Suddenly, a cold wind blows through
               the street, causing everyone to shiver. Harry exhales and his breath is tinged with
               frost. The street lights flicker, die, and frost over. Dudley is turning in a circle,
               terrified. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#DUDLEY">What's happening? </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">Quiet! The stars go out, plunging them into darkness. Dudley yells in
            fear. Harry turns to the end of the street. Gliding as smooth as death over the street,
            tattered robes drifting in the wind, comes a DEMENTOR. </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">Dudley! Run!<stage> He turns, grabs his cousin by the arm and drags him
               down an alleyway. Beyond the mouth of the alleyway is the next street, and Number
               Four, Privet Drive. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">Come on!<stage> They break into a run. A dementor drifts into the alleyway
               in front of them. Skidding to a stop, Harry turns around, to find the other dementor
               cutting off the way back. Harry spots a fire escape ladder, leading onto the roof of
               the house. He taps Dudley on the back, and starts to point to it, when Dudley turns
               and punches Harry in the jaw. Dazed, Harry stumbles backwards and falls to his back.
               His glasses slide from his face. His wand clatters away from him. Crying, Dudley runs
               away from Harry, towards the first dementor. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">Dudley, no!<stage> Harry feels the ground for his glasses but cannot find
               them. His hands scrabble on the ground in desperation. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">Lumos!<stage> Three feet away from him, his wand lights up. Harry snatches
               it up and turns. The dementor closes the distance to Harry swiftly, and is suddenly
               right before him. Harry raises his wand. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">'Expecto Patronum!'<stage> A wisp of misty light protrudes from the tip of
               his wand, but not enough. Harry stiffens and gasps. The dementor closes in for the
               kill. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#VOLDEMORT"><stage>V.O.</stage> Bow to death, Harry... </sp>
         <sp who="#LILYPOTTER"><stage>V.O.</stage> Haaaaaaaarry!...<stage> Harry falls onto his
               back, and the dementor closes the distance. Dudley SCREAMS in the black. Harry
               glances at him. Dudley is on his back, hands pulled apart by the other dementor, and
               the great cloaked head lowering to deliver the kiss. Harry raises his wand in
               desperation. HARRY 'EXPECTO PATRONUM!' There is a blinding explosion of light as
               Harry's PATRONOUS bursts forth, blasting the dementor backwards and away. The light
               INTENSIFIES, PULSATING from Harry's wand, expanding to fill the alley with wave after
               pulsing wave of PURE LIGHT. The dementors flee. The stars, and street lamps flicker
               to life again. Dudley lays on the ground, whimpering and shaking. </stage></sp>
         <stage>FOOTSTEPS from behind Harry. He turns, wand at the ready, to see UNCLE VERNON and
            AUNT PETUNIA running up to him. He starts to lower it. But they are staring dumbfounded
            into the sky, watching the Dementors soar away. </stage>
         <sp who="#UNCLEVERNON">What the hell are those? </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">Dementors. Petunia kneels on the ground next to Dudley. </sp>
         <sp who="#AUNTPETUNIA">What happened, Duddikins? Vernon turns on Harry, who hastily lowers his
            wand. </sp>
         <sp who="#UNCLEVERNON">What the hell is a dementoid? Petunia seizes Dudley and attempts to look
            into his mouth. </sp>
         <sp who="#AUNTPETUNIA">They didn't--? </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">No. Vernon shoves a large finger at Harry. </sp>
         <sp who="#UNCLEVERNON">I want some answers! </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">We were attacked. </sp>
         <sp who="#UNCLEVERNON">By those...things? </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">They're evil. If they get the chance, they'll suck your soul out through
            your mouth. </sp>
         <sp who="#AUNTPETUNIA">They guard the wizard prison, Azkaban. <stage>Vernon and Harry look
            dumbfounded.</stage></sp>
         <sp who="#UNCLEVERNON">How do you know that? <stage>Petunia shakes her head, looking panicky.
               Vernon helps Dudley unsteadily to his feet, patting him on the shoulder.
            </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#UNCLEVERNON">Fought 'em off, eh, Dud? Gave 'em the ol' one-two? </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">You can't give a Dementor the 'ol one-two.' </sp>
         <sp who="#UNCLEVERNON">Why is he all right then? </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">Because I used magic to save his life! The street-lights die, plunging the
            street into darkness.<stage> Several cloaked people appear around them on the street.
               The Dursleys yell in surprise. They move closer. Harry stands, brandishing his wand.
            </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">Lumos!<stage> Ten wizards stand around them, wands out. Mad-eye Moody,
               Remus Lupin, Nymphadora Tonks, Kingsley Shacklebolt, Elphias Doge, Dedalus Diggle,
               Emmeline Vance, Sturgis Podmore, and Hestia Jones. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#UNCLEVERNON">Who are all you lot? </sp>
         <sp who="#MOODY">Quiet, Dursley. </sp>
         <sp who="#LUPIN">Harry, douse the light. We're exposed here. </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY"><stage>nodding</stage> Nox.<stage> Darkness returns to the street, which
               is now lit only by the light of the moon. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">What are you doing here? </sp>
         <sp who="#LUPIN">We're your advanced guard, Harry. Dumbledore just sent us as soon as he
            heard about the attack. We're taking you to safety. We're just waiting for the all
            clear. </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">How'd he know? It just happened! </sp>
         <sp who="#LUPIN">You didn't think Dumbledore'd let you wander around on your own, did you?
            Lupin indicates Tonks. </sp>
         <sp who="#LUPIN">Harry, I don't believe you've met Nymphadora Tonks. She smiles at him. </sp>
         <sp who="#LUPIN">Tonks, would you go get Harry's broom from the house? She nods and
               departs.<stage> Harry looks at Lupin. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">What's been going on? What's Lord Vol- Three of the advanced guard jump. </sp>
         <sp who="#MOODY">We're not talking about it here, it's too risky. Moody's eye stuck
            backwards in his head. </sp>
         <sp who="#MOODY">Blast it.<stage> He pulls his eye from it's socket with a horrible sucking
               sound. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#TONKS">Mad-eye, dear, you do realize that's disgusting? </sp>
         <sp who="#MOODY">I want 365 degree visibility on the return trip. </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">How are we getting there? </sp>
         <sp who="#LUPIN">Brooms. Red sparks fly into the air in the distance. Tonks returns with
            the broom, handing it to Harry. </sp>
         <sp who="#SHACKLEBOLT">There's the first signal. </sp>
         <sp who="#MOODY">Right, let's go. </sp>
         <sp who="#LUPIN">On your broom, Harry. Moody is moving around them. </sp>
         <sp who="#MOODY">Form up! Form up around Harry. Make it snappy!<stage> The advanced guard
               surrounds Harry. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#MOODY">We'll be flying in close-quarters formation. Tonks will be right in front
            of you, keep close to her at all times. <stage>pause</stage> Don't stop, and whatever
            you do, don't break formation. If any of us are killed, the rest of you, keep flying.
               <stage>pause</stage> If that were to happen, the survivors, fly to the east. The rear
            guard is standing by. They will find you. </sp>
         <sp who="#TONKS">Stop being so cheerful, Mad-eye. </sp>
         <sp who="#MOODY">We must be ready. This would be the perfect moment for Voldemort to strike
            Harry. </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">Uh, is that very likely? </sp>
         <sp who="#SHACKLEBOLT">No one's going to die. Blue sparks blast into the sky. </sp>
         <sp who="#LUPIN">There's the second signal! </sp>
         <sp who="#MOODY">Mount your brooms, everyone. Here we go!<stage> Seconds later, there is an
               explosion of green sparks in the sky. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#MOODY">The third signal, everyone. Let's go! They kick off from the ground, which
            is swiftly left behind. </sp>
         <sp who="#MOODY">Stay in formation!<stage> They are not as high as the clouds yet.
            </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#MOODY">We need more height!<stage> It is only seconds later, that another warning
               is shouted their way. A dementor soars towards them, tattered robes snapping in the
               wind. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#MOODY">Contacts to the south! </sp>
         <sp who="#SHACKLEBOLT">Mad-eye! You, Tonks, and Lupin take Harry! We'll slow them down! The
            rest of the advanced guard peels away from the group. Harry checks the sky around them.
            It appears to be clear. </sp>
         <sp who="#LUPIN">There's the other one, Alastor! The other Dementor emerges very close by
            from a cloud. </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">Expecto--! </sp>
         <sp who="#LUPIN">Harry, leave it to us! And Lupin peels away, rocketing towards the
            Dementor. </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">No!<stage> Lupin goes straight at the Dementor, which smoothly flips
               upwards, bypassing Lupin, but Lupin twists his broom around, his wand drawn, and
               points it at the Dementor's retreating back. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#LUPIN">'Expecto Patronum!'<stage> Lupin's PATRONOUS explodes from his wand tip,
               pulsing out through the clouds at the Dementor. The light blasts into it, and the
               Dementor, shrieking eerily, retreats back towards the rest of the advanced guard.
               Lupin rockets past Harry, Tonks, and Moody. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#LUPIN">Get Harry to the safe house! </sp>
         <sp who="#MOODY">Come on, Potter! Keep moving! </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">But I can help! </sp>
         <sp who="#MOODY">Potter, getting yourself killed won't do a thing. Now move!<stage> Glaring
               at Moody, Harry wheels his broom around and the three of them set off again, leaving
               the battle behind. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#MOODY">We're not far, now!<stage> Soon after, Lupin and the rest of the advanced
               guard return, intact and without injury. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#MOODY">Did you get rid of them? </sp>
         <sp who="#SHACKLEBOLT">They're gone, Alastor. </sp>
         <sp who="#TONKS">We're there! </sp>
         <sp who="#MOODY">Prepare for descent! Form up around Harry!<stage> They cut through the
               clouds, gliding lower as they went. Tonks touches down right before Harry did, the
               rest gliding down while maintaining their formation around Harry. All business, they
               draw their wands. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#LUPIN">Stay here, Harry.<stage> Several of the advanced guard move to the
               perimeter, to secure it. Clear! </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#SHACKLEBOLT"> </sp>
         <sp who="#MOODY"> Right, Harry, this way.<stage> Harry follows him, Tonks and Lupin
               trailing after, wands at the ready, eyes flicking to the buildings surrounding them.
            </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#MOODY">Here, read this.<stage> He hands Harry a piece of paper. It has written on
               it: "The Headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix may be found at Number Twelve,
               Grimmauld Place, London." Harry looks at the gap between the houses, and suddenly a
               door appears, followed by the rest of a large, gray, rather imposing house. Moody
               takes the paper from Harry and set it afire with his wand. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#MOODY">Come on, inside. Hurry. </sp>
         <stage>LUPIN and TONKS step up, close to Harry, one on either side. The guards at the
            perimeter close in a semi-circle around the door. </stage>
         <stage>LUPIN taps the door with his wand, and it cracks open. </stage>
         <sp who="#LUPIN">Get in, quick, Harry. Don't touch anything. </sp>
      </scene>
      <scene>
         <stage cat="INT" where="GRIMMAULD  PLACE  -  NIGHT"> Harry enters the musty entry hall. To
            one side is a staircase leading up to the next level. At the base of the stair is a
            dirty, graying sheet hanging on the wall, as if it were covering something. Behind him,
            the other members of the advanced guard are entering. To make room, Harry steps to one
            side, and runs into an umbrella stand, which clangs loudly as it hits the ground. To
            steady himself, he reaches out and pulls the sheet from the wall. Behind it is a
            portrait of an unpleasant, old, thin, woman. </stage>
         <sp who="#MRSBLACK">Filth! Scum! Half-breeds, mutants, freaks, begone from this place!
            How dare you befoul the house of my fathers?! </sp>
         <stage>SIRIUS BLACK comes running into the entry hall. He skids to a halt next to Harry,
            looking up at MRS BLACK. </stage>
         <sp who="#SIRIUS">Shut up, you miserable old hag! Quiet! </sp>
         <sp who="#MRSBLACK">Blood traitor, abomination, shame of my flesh! </sp>
         <sp who="#SIRIUS">Yes, yes, do shut up! He throws the sheet over the picture, and the yells
            die away.<stage> Panting, SIRIUS looks at Harry and grins. He wraps Harry in a huge bear
               hug. Harry laughs. Pulling away, Sirius smiles at Harry. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">Was that your--? </sp>
         <sp who="#SIRIUS">Mother, yes. Dear old mum. </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">But...why here? </sp>
         <sp who="#SIRIUS">This house has been my family's for centuries. It's mine now.
               <stage>pause</stage> I'm the last of the Blacks. I offered it up as headquarters for,
            well, and Dumbledore accepted. It's about the most useful thing I've been able to do for
            a long while. </sp>
         <stage>MRS WEASLEY enters the hall. </stage>
         <sp who="#MRSWEASLEY">Hello, Harry dear. </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">Mrs. Weasley! </sp>
         <sp who="#MRSWEASLEY">Sirius, the meeting is about to start!<stage> Right. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#SIRIUS"> </sp>
         <sp who="#MRSWEASLEY"> Harry, dear, go on upstairs- quietly, if you please. They're all up
            there. Harry looks up the stairs. </sp>
         <sp who="#HERMIONE">Harry!<stage> Harry looks up the stairs and sees RON and HERMIONE
               standing on the landing. He mounts the stairs to both of them, grinning. Hermione
               throws herself on Harry in a large hug, laughing. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#RON">Let him breathe, Hermione! </sp>
         <sp who="#HERMIONE">Oh, Harry! We've missed you! Are you furious with us, I bet you are! </sp>
         <sp who="#RON">HERMIONE!</sp>
         <stage>Hermione lets Harry go and takes a deep breath. </stage>
         <sp who="#RON">Good to see you, mate. </sp>
         <sp who="#HERMIONE">Come on, inside. They enter an adjacent bedroom. INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
            They sit down on separate beds. </sp>
         <sp who="#HERMIONE">Sorry we haven't written, Harry, but Dumbledore made us promise not to. </sp>
         <sp who="#RON">We wanted to, mate, we really did, but he thought they would get

            asking about Voldemort.<stage> Harry pauses, then turns around. The room has gone very
               still. Mrs. Weasley is glaring at Sirius. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">I wanted to, but I didn't think you'd tell me anything. </sp>
         <sp who="#MRSWEASLEY">And that was quite right, Harry! You're much to young-- </sp>

         <sp who="#SIRIUS">What do you want to know, Harry? </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">Where's Voldemort? What's he doing? </sp>
         <sp who="#SIRIUS">He's hiding for the moment, because the Ministry is ignoring his return

         <sp who="#SIRIUS">He's building up his army again, just like before. </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">And you're stopping him from gaining followers? </sp>
         <sp who="#LUPIN">We're doing our best, but it's proving to be...difficult. </sp>
         <sp who="#SIRIUS">You see, when the Ministry of Magic insists that Voldemort isn't back. </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">But...why? </sp>
         <sp who="#LUPIN">Fudge likes being Minister of Magic. If it turns out that Voldemort came
            back under his watch, he'll be sacked. </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">But you're telling people, right? Sirius laughed. </sp>
         <sp who="#SIRIUS">Well, they think I'm a mass- murderer, Lupin is a werewolf, Tonks and
            Arthur would lose their jobs at the Ministry... </sp>
         <sp who="#LUPIN">But Dumbledore is doing all he can. </sp>

            would just say a few words. I am here at the Ministry of Magic's bequest, under
            Educational Decree twenty-two, which states that if the Headmaster of Hogwarts is unable

            children to be of vital importance, and the passing down of this ancient and noble art
            must be given to the next generation, lest it be lost forever... <stage>pause</stage>
            Without progress, stagnation. But progress for progress's sake is to be discouraged, for
            our art requires no tinkering. <stage>pause</stage> A balance must be attained, the new
            and the old, permanence and change, tradition and innovation, order and chaos.
               <stage>pause</stage> There are large changes coming soon, changes walking the fine
            line between order and chaos. Know only that these changes are for the best, and to
            prevent the destruction of our civilization from its own decay. Thank you.<stage>

               in the skin of his hand, and the quill had written the words on the parchment in
               bright red BLOOD. Then the words healed over again, on his hand. Harry glances at

            him. Suddenly an invisible force grabs him and pulls him along, faster and faster, the
            doors a blur. Then he saw the end, a blinding light, which he blasts into with a SMACK,
            and as the light fades, he catches a glimpse of a further room, beyond the light, for
            only an instant. Then it too is gone, and Harry awakes with a yelp, hands pressed

            everywhere. </stage>
         <sp who="#LEEJORDAN">...and Slytherin is up forty to ten. Alica with the quaffle!<stage>
               Alica spins through the blizzard, trying desperately to see. Two shapes emerge from
               the snow. They are CRABBE and GOYLE, the Slytherin Beaters. Both of them take a swing
               at her. She twists completely around on her broom and the clubs swish harmlessly
               past. She pushes forward to the Slytherin goals and hurtles the quaffle. Blocked by
               the Slytherin Keeper! Below, in the stands, there is a groan from the Gryffindor
               side. From the Slytherins, there is a chant. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#SLYTHERINS">Weasley is our King, Weasley is our King, He always lets the Quaffle
            in, Weasley is our King!<stage> Harry pulls up near to Ron, who is looking grimly sick
               to his stomach. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">Just ignore them, Ron! Ron does not acknowledge him.<stage> Several
               Slytherins, in possession of the Quaffle, bear down on the Gryffindor goals. They
               throw the quaffle. Ron dives and misses. A loud GONG sounds. Another groan from the
               Gryffindors. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#LEEJORDAN"><stage>v.o.</stage> Another ten points to Slytherin. The score is now
            fifty-ten in favor of Slytherin. Malfoy pulls up on his broom near Ron as well. </sp>
         <sp who="#DRACO">I should thank you, Weasley. You're definitely our best player!<stage> He
               laughs. Just then, the SNITCH blasts past Malfoy. He takes off in pursuit. Harry
               rockets after him at top speed, ignoring the bite of the snow against his face. He
               and Malfoy give chase, following the Snitch at top speed. Malfoy is still far closer
               than Harry. Then the Snitch BANKS SHARPLY. Both Draco and Harry turn with it, though
               now Harry has pulled even with Draco. They are inches from the Snitch. They reach
               with all of their might. Harry's hand inches out in front of Draco and closes around
               the Snitch. Draco's fingers scrabble on the back of Harry's gloved hand. The crowd
               goes wild. Harry straightens, triumphant. Behind him, without warning, Crabbe emerges
               from the blizzard and CRACKS Harry across the back of the head with his Beater's
               club. Harry slumps forward, and nose-dives into the pitch, rolling to a stop looking
               dazed. There is a groan of sympathy from the crowd. The other Gryffindors land and
               run to Harry. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#HERMIONE">Harry, are you all right? He is helped to his feet by Fred and George. </sp>
         <sp who="#DRACO">Bet you loved that, Potter! Saved Weasley's neck, didn't you? The
            Gryffindors ignore him. </sp>
         <sp who="#DRACO">I've never seen a worse Keeper! Maybe we should add some more verses to
            our little song. About his filthy mother! George tries to leap at Draco. Harry and Fred
            hold him back. </sp>
         <sp who="#DRACO">And his pathetic loser of a father too!<stage> Fred attempts to charge
               Draco too. Other Gryffindors are restraining them now. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#DRACO">But then, you like the Weasleys, don't you? How can you stand the stink? I
            guess it reminds you of your own dear mother!<stage> Harry turns and runs full out at
               Draco, who looks startled as Harry leaps at him, CRUSHING his fist into Draco's jaw
               and knocking him to the ground. George breaks free of the Gryffindors and follows,
               hitting Malfoy too. Harry leaps onto Draco, hitting him again and again.
            </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#MADAMHOOCH">Impedimenta!<stage> She blasts Harry and George with her spell,
               knocking them off of Malfoy. McGonagall storms onto the pitch, Gryffindor scarf
               flapping wildly in the wind. </stage></sp>

         <sp who="#HOOCH">Don't make me stupify you, Potter!<stage> Harry stops, breathing hard,
               glaring daggers at Malfoy, who is curling in a ball, bleeding and crying. McGonagall
               comes right up to Harry and grabs him hard by the elbow. He finally turns his
               attention to her. She is pale and grim-faced. </stage></sp>

         <sp who="#MCGONAGALL">Now, I don't care what Malfoy said. Your performance out there was

         <sp who="#SNAPE">As you are well aware, I will be teaching you Occlumency. The headmaster

            it? </sp>
         <sp who="#SNAPE">Yes, it did, but at the expense of our advantage. The connection between
            you was so powerful during your vision of the snake that the Dark Lord became aware of
            it. The Headmaster fears that he may try to use this to his advantage, to manipulate you

         <sp who="#FUDGE">Well, well, well, Mr. Potter! I expect you know why you're here?<stage>
               Harry glances at Dumbledore. The Headmaster shakes his head, ever so slightly.
            </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">Not really, no. </sp>
         <sp who="#FUDGE">You don't? You haven't broken any school rules? </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">School rules? No. </sp>
         <sp who="#FUDGE">Or Ministerial Decrees? </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">Not that I know of.<stage> Umbridge opens the door again, leading
               Marietta, Cho's friend, into the room. She has been crying, and her face is covered
               in PIMPLES forming the word "SNEAK." </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#UMBRIDGE">I'm afraid the poor girl is unable to speak. But I shall tell you what
            has transpired. <stage>pause</stage> Shortly after dinner she came to me and said that
            if I went to the Room of Requirement I would find an illegally-formed student group.
               <stage>pause</stage> It was at that time that this hex took affect. She gestures to
            Marietta's face. </sp>
         <sp who="#UMBRIDGE">Since I had received information some time ago that Potter and a number
            of other students had met in the Hog's Head to start an illegal group-- </sp>
         <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE">I'm not sure that's true, Professor.<stage> I'm sorry? </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#UMBRIDGE"> </sp>
         <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE"> In point of fact, when young Potter met those students it was not
            illegal. </sp>
         <sp who="#UMBRIDGE">But two days later, Educational Decree Twenty-Four was introduced. </sp>
         <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE">Again, quite correct. However, I wonder if you have any evidence that
            proves this group has been meeting since then? </sp>
         <sp who="#UMBRIDGE">I have a witness right here! </sp>
         <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE">Correct again. I must confess that I was, however, under the
            impression that this young girl only told you a meeting was going on tonight. </sp>
         <sp who="#UMBRIDGE">Let's ask her, shall we? She turns to Marietta, who is staring at the
            wall. </sp>
         <sp who="#UMBRIDGE">You can shake your head for an answer, dear. Now, have there been more
            meetings? Slowly, still staring at the wall, Marietta shakes her head. </sp>
         <sp who="#UMBRIDGE">What do you mean by shaking your head, girl? </sp>
         <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE">I would think that she was saying there have been no other meetings.
            Would that be correct?<stage> She nods. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#UMBRIDGE">But what about Potter? He was the leader, and has been--<stage> To
               Umbridge's astonishment, Marietta is shaking her head yet again. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#UMBRIDGE">Why are you shaking your head, girl? </sp>
         <sp who="#MCGONAGALL">It usually means 'no,' Dolores. Umbridge grabs Marietta by the cloak
            and shakes her roughly.<stage> Dumbledore stands, and there is anger in his voice. He
               draws his wand and points it at Umbridge. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE">Again, I cannot have you manhandling my students, Professor Umbridge.
            She laughs, softly, and lets Marietta go. </sp>
         <sp who="#UMBRIDGE">My apologies, Headmaster. I forgot myself. </sp>
         <sp who="#FUDGE">Well, what about the meeting tonight? </sp>
         <sp who="#UMBRIDGE">Right. Of course. Well, we proceeded down to the Room and entered.
               <stage>pause</stage> We caught Potter just outside. But it doesn't matter. We've
            found all of their names.<stage> She pulls the roster list Hermione had made up from her
               pocket. Harry gaps at it in horror. Fudge gapes at it as well. He snatches it out of
               Umbridge's hands. He looks up, an expression of twisted delight on his face.
            </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#FUDGE">So, Dumbledore, you've been behind this whole thing.<stage> He hands the
               paper to Dumbledore, who looks at it. He seems suddenly at a loss for words.
            </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#FUDGE">
            <stage>harsh whisper</stage> Dumbledore's Army. Dumbledore smiles pleasantly and spreads
            his hands widely. </sp>
         <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE">Well, Minister. You've caught me. </sp>
         <sp who="#FUDGE">This has all been your doing! You've been recruiting students for your
            army! </sp>
         <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE">Quite correct, Cornelius. </sp>
         <sp who="#FUDGE">I knew it! I KNEW it! You've been plotting against me all this time! </sp>
         <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE">
            <stage>pleasantly</stage> That's right. </sp>
         <sp who="#FUDGE">This is too good to be true! Harry turns to Dumbledore in horror. </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">Professor, no! </sp>
         <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE">Quiet, Harry! </sp>
         <sp who="#FUDGE">Yes, shut up, Potter. So, you'll be coming with us to the Ministry-- </sp>
         <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE">Ah, yes. I was wondering when we'd hit that little snag. </sp>
         <sp who="#FUDGE">I see no snag, Dumbledore. </sp>
         <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE">But I do. You seem to be laboring under the delusion that I would
            'come quietly.' </sp>
         <sp who="#FUDGE">Resisting arrest, now are you, Dumbledore? </sp>
         <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE">Precisely. You see, I have absolutely no intention of going to
               Azkaban.<stage> The Auror next to Kingsley slowly moves his hand towards his pocket.
            </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE">Don't be silly, Hawkes. Leave the wand there.<stage> The man stops.
            </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#FUDGE">You would really take on two Aurors, Dolores, and myself, Dumbledore? </sp>
         <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE">Naturally. All of you did rather well on your spellwork at this
            school, but if you attempt to take me in by force, I'm afraid I shall have to hurt
               you.<stage> In one motion, all of them draw their wands. Harry dives for cover.
               Dumbledore is fastest. There is an instant of BLINDING LIGHT as spells blast in all
               directions. A spell strikes Dumbledore's desk with a BANG, and explodes. Dust fills
               the room. There is a shout and some SCUFFLING OF FEET, another BANG, and silence.
               Harry blinks and stands as the dust settles. Dumbledore hasn't moved. Fudge, the
               Auror, Dolores, Kingsley, and Percy are all laying on the floor, unconscious.
               Dumbledore's desk has been broken in half, and all of the tables overturned. He moves
               swiftly to McGonagall, Harry, and Marietta. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE">Are you all right? McGonagall is standing, dusting herself off. </sp>
         <sp who="#MCGONAGALL">Yes, we're fine. <stage>pause</stage> Oh, where will you go, Albus? </sp>
         <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE">I'm not going into hiding. Fudge will soon regret removing me from
            Hogwarts. Harry moves to Dumbledore's side. </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">I'm so sorry, Professor!<stage> Dumbledore smiles at him. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE">It's fine. Now listen to me, Harry. Keep studying Occlumency! Do
            everything Professor Snape tells you. He grips Harry's shoulder. </sp>
         <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE">Close your mind! You will understand, in time. Fudge is stirring. </sp>
         <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE">Lay back down. They must not think we have had time to talk. They do
            so. He moves to Fawkes.<stage> Fudge opens his eyes. Dumbledore grabs onto Fawkes' tail,
               and the two VANISH in a BLAST of FIRE. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#FUDGE">Find him!<stage> Umbridge, Percy, Kingsley, the auror, and Fudge race from

         <sp who="#HARRY">Oh, yeah. Well, I did think about being an Auror. </sp>
         <sp who="#MCGONAGALL">Auror. Interesting, Potter. You'll need top grades for that.

         <sp who="#MCGONAGALL">Now then, Potter, you'll need to concentrate on Defense Against the

         <sp who="#MCGONAGALL">If you're serious in this ambition, Potter, I would recommend
            concentrating on bringing your Potions and Charms grades up before your O.W.L.s. I
            daresay you've got enough time if you apply yourself. Lord knows you've consistently

         <sp who="#MCGONAGALL">Yes, indeed I have. </sp>

            poor this year. </sp>
         <sp who="#MCGONAGALL">You apparently misunderstand me. I meant that Potter has done well in
            every Defense Against the Dark Arts class taught by a competent teacher.<stage> She

         <sp who="#HERMIONE">I don't think Sirius is here. Ron stares at one of the orbs. </sp>
         <sp who="#RON">Harry, have you seen this? Harry looks over his shoulder. </sp>
         <sp who="#RON">Er...it's got your name on it. Sure enough, there was a golden orb resting
            on the shelf with the label "S.P.T. to A.P.W.B.D.: The Dark Lord and <stage>?</stage>
            Harry Potter."<stage> Harry reaches out for it. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">What's my name doing here? </sp>
         <sp who="#HERMIONE">Don't touch it, Harry! Harry glares at her.<stage> Why not?
            </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY"> </sp>
         <sp who="#NEVILLE"> Yeah, Harry, don't. He looks at Neville, who is very pale. </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">It's got my name on it! He takes it off the shelf and looks at it. </sp>
         <sp who="#LUCIUS">I warned you before that one day you would come to a sticky end, Potter. </sp>
         <stage>LUCIUS MALFOY emerges from the shadows, cloaked all in black. Two dozen other Death
            Eaters emerge around him. Harry and the others are surrounded and outnumbered. </stage>
         <sp who="#HARRY">Where's Sirius? Lucius, and several other death eaters laugh. </sp>
         <sp who="#LUCIUS">We don't have him, if that's what you mean. Harry is stunned. </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">You never did, did you? It was all just a trick. </sp>
         <sp who="#LUCIUS">The Dark Lord knows your weakness for heroics, Potter. All it took was a
            little nudge to get you here.<stage> Lucius reaches out his hand, palm up. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#LUCIUS">Now give me that prophesy. </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">What prophesy? Lucius points at the Golden orb. </sp>
         <sp who="#LUCIUS">That prophesy. Now hand it over or we'll have to use wands on you.<stage>
               Harry raises his wand at the same time that Ginny, Neville, Hermione, Ron, and Luna
               raised theirs. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">Go ahead. Lucius regards him coldly. </sp>
         <sp who="#LUCIUS">Very brave of you, Potter. Or are you foolish? </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">Come and find out! Lucius doesn't move. </sp>
         <sp who="#LUCIUS">Really, Potter. You expect to defeat all of us with your little school
            friends? Now hand it over, and they won't have to die here.<stage> One of the Death
               Eaters moves forward, throwing back her hood. It is BELLATRIX LESTRANGE.
            </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#BELLATRIX">I haven't escaped from Azkaban for this! She raises her wand. Lucius
            forces her arm down. </sp>
         <sp who="#LUCIUS">No! If the prophesy is smashed--<stage> He stops and turns back to Harry.
               But Bellatrix turns to several other Death Eaters. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#BELLATRIX">Take the youngest girl. We'll see how committed Potter is as we
            torture her.<stage> Ron, Hermione, Luna, and Neville close in around Ginny. Harry steps
               in front of Ginny, wand out and aimed at Bellatrix's chest. He holds the prophesy in
               his other hand. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">You even try to take her and I'll smash this thing.<stage> He tosses the
               prophesy casually into the air and catches it again. Lucius starts in horror.
            </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">So, what kind of prophesy are we talking about here? </sp>
         <sp who="#BELLATRIX">Surely you jest, Potter? </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">Not really. How come Voldemort wants it? </sp>
         <sp who="#LUCIUS">You dare to speak the Dark Lord's name? </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">Who, Voldemort? Oh, yeah, I dare. Voldemort, voldemort, Voldemort-- </sp>
         <sp who="#BELLATRIX">Silence! How dare you utter that name from your half-blood mouth! </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">Hey, did you know Voldemort's a half-blood too? Bella raises her wand to
            strike, but Malfoy stops her again. </sp>
         <sp who="#LUCIUS">Control yourself, Bellatrix! </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">What's so special about this prophesy anyway? Bella shrieks with laughter. </sp>
         <sp who="#LUCIUS">You mean Dumbledore never told you the reason you bear that scar was
            hidden here? Harry looks as if slapped, he is so surprised. </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">What? Lucius and the Death Eaters laugh. </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY"><stage>whispering</stage> When I give the signal, blast the shelves...
            Hermione and Ron nod grimly. </sp>
         <sp who="#LUCIUS">So that's what took you so long. We wondered. </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">But why did he need me to take it? </sp>
         <sp who="#LUCIUS">Only a person for whom the prophesy was made can remove it from its self,
            Potter, and the Dark Lord certainly couldn't get it himself. Harry is angry. </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">So he used me to do his dirty work, did he? </sp>
         <sp who="#LUCIUS">Precisely, Potter. </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">NOW!</sp>
         <stage> No less than six wands fire into the shelves at once. The Death Eaters cover their
            faces as DEBRIS covers them. </stage>
         <sp who="#HARRY">RUN!</sp>
         <stage> Dust fills the air. Entire shelves fall CRASHING to the ground, raining glass
            shards and golden orbs. The students break and run for the door. Malfoy grabs Harry by
            the shoulder. Hermione waves her wand at him. </stage>
         <sp who="#HERMIONE">Stupify!<stage> Malfoy is blasted backward. Harry and Hermione run
               after the others. Spells explode around them. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#LUCIUS">Stop them! Harry is the last through the door. </sp>
      </scene>
      <scene>
         <stage cat="INT" where="CLOCK  ROOM  -  NIGHT"> Hermione slams the door shut and points her
            wand at it. </stage>
         <sp who="#HERMIONE">Colloportus! The door seals itself.<stage> Harry looks around. Only
               Hermione and Neville are still with him. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">Where'd the rest go? Hermione looks around. </sp>
         <sp who="#HERMIONE">Harry, they went the wrong way!<stage> They run after Ron, Ginny, and
               Luna. Just then, the door blasts off its hinges. Harry, Hermione, and Neville dive
               underneath several desks. Death Eaters enter the room, slowly moving between the
               clocks and desks. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#DEATHEATER">They might have gone on to the hall. </sp>
         <sp who="#BELLATRIX">Check under the desks. Harry leaps out from under his desk. </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">Stupify!<stage> A JET of RED LIGHT hits one of the Death Eaters in the
               chest. He is knocked backward into the wall. Hermione jumps from under her desk and
               runs for the exit. Bellatrix sees her and raises her wand. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#BELLATRIX">Avada-- Neville emerges from beneath his desk. </sp>
         <sp who="#NEVILLE">Expelliarmus! Bella's wand flies from her fingers. Harry finishes her
            off. </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">Stupify!<stage> Bellatrix is STRUCK with the same red light and falls to
               the ground. There is a YELL from the next room. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">Ron! Two Death Eaters enter the room. </sp>
         <sp who="#DEATHEATER">Impedimenta!<stage> The spell blasts Harry, Hermione, and Neville
               backward. Neville flies over a desk. Hermione strikes a bookshelf and is nearly
               buried under the falling books, and Harry strikes the wall. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#DEATHEATER">We've got him! </sp>
         <sp who="#HERMIONE">Silenco! Stupify! The death eater falls silent, and then to the ground.
            Harry staggers to his feet, dazed. </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">Pretificus Totalus!<stage> The second Death Eater falls to the ground and
               cannot move. The mute Death Eater attacks Hermione, making a slashing movement with
               his wand. Purple flame BLASTS from the wand and slashes Hermione across the chest.
               Her eyes go wide and she falls to the ground. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#NEVILLE">Stupify! The death eater falls over. </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">Hermione! He runs to her. She appears to be sleeping. </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">Please don't be dead, please don't be dead... He shakes her. </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">Hermione, wake up... Neville runs over. </sp>
         <sp who="#NEVILLE">What's they do to her? Harry shakes his head. Neville feels her wrist. </sp>
         <sp who="#NEVILLE">She's alive, Harry. There's a pulse. Harry sighs in relief. </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">Can we carry her? </sp>
         <sp who="#NEVILLE">I'll do it. You're better at fighting.<stage> He hoists Hermione up on
               his back. They move on to the next room. </stage></sp>

         <stage cat="INT" where="ROOM  OF  DOORS  -  NIGHT"> Harry, and Neville, still carrying
            Hermione, re-emerge into the circular room of doors. Hermione's X's have fades from the

         <sp who="#NEVILLE">Where do we go? </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">I don't know...<stage> A door opens and Luna and Ginny emerge, helping Ron
               walk between them. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">What happened. </sp>
         <sp who="#GINNY">I think my ankle's broken. And somebody hit Ron with a weird spell... Ron
            laughs strangely. </sp>
         <sp who="#RON">Hiyya, Harry. <stage>he giggles</stage> You look funny.... He laughs
               again.<stage> Ginny's legs give way, and both she and Ron fall to the ground. Harry
               is at Ginny's side, looking concerned. She is breathing very hard. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#LUNA">They hit her with something too. Harry straightens. </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">We need to get out of here. Luna, can you help Ginny? Luna moves to her
            side. Another door opens, and five death eaters emerge. </sp>
         <sp who="#BELLATRIX">There they are!<stage> Stunning spells rain all around them. The
               wounded group heads for the nearest door. Luna is blasted off her feet by a stunning
               spell. She and Ginny TUMBLE to the floor. Harry has no choice but to keep running.
               The next stunning spell hits Neville in the back. He falls to the ground, Hermione
               rolling away from him. </stage></sp>

      <scene>
         <stage cat="INT" where="ROOM  OF  THE  VEIL  -  NIGHT"> Harry and Ron stagger into the Room
            of the Veil. Just as they enter, Ron is hit and falls. Harry slips and tumbles down to
            the bottom of the chamber. He comes to rest by the DAIS of the Veil. Doors all around
            him burst open and Death Eaters enter, climbing down to surround him--from a safe
            distance. Harry staggers up onto the dais, his wand held weakly in his hand. Blood
            trickles out of his mouth and down his chin. Malfoy shoves his way towards Harry. </stage>
         <sp who="#LUCIUS">Your race is run, Potter. Hand it over. Harry glances around frantically. </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">Let my friends go and I will.<stage> Bellatrix and several other Death
               Eaters drag his friends into the chamber. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#LUCIUS">You are not in a position to negotiate. Neville struggles against the

         <sp who="#NEVILLE">Don't do it, Harry! Don't! </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">Stop, Neville!<stage> Bellatrix looks at Neville. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#BELLATRIX">Neville? Neville Longbottom? She laughs in glee. </sp>
         <sp who="#BELLATRIX">My dear boy, I paid your parents a visit a long time ago. We had such
            a time! </sp>
         <sp who="#NEVILLE">You put them in St. Mungos! Bellatrix beams at him. </sp>
         <sp who="#BELLATRIX">So, Potter. Give us the Prophesy or I'll see how long it takes to
            crack Longbottom like his parents. Harry is desperate. </sp>
         <sp who="#NEVILLE">Don't give it to them! Bellatrix points her wand at him. </sp>
         <sp who="#BELLATRIX">Crucio!<stage> Neville HOWLS in PAIN, curling up in a ball and
               SCREAMING at the top of his lungs. The doors at the top of the chamber EXPLODE off
               their hinges. Everything stops as Lupin, Sirius, Moody, Tonks, and Kingsley. They
               BLAST spells at the Death Eaters. Malfoy moves to attack, but Tonks disarms him.
               Harry leaps off of the DAIS, landing next to Neville. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">Are you all right? </sp>
         <sp who="#NEVILLE">Yeah...<stage> He and Harry begin making their way away from the
               fighting. A man grabs Harry from behind, his large, sweaty arm around Harry's throat.
            </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#DEATHEATER">Give me the prophesy!<stage> Neville leaps upon his back and hits him
               in the face. Harry elbows him in the ribs. The man falls away. As he falls, he
               strikes Harry's hand by accident. The prophesy flies from his hand. Malfoy sees it.
               He raises his wand. Sirius leaps into him. Both men fall the rest of the way to the
               lowest level of the room, landing hard. The prophesy bounces off of a step, flips
               down to the next level and shatters against the stone. A GHOSTLY version of Professor
               Trelawney appears over the shattered golden orb, speaks something which cannot be
               heard over the fight, and dissolves away. Harry and Neville seem frozen, staring at
               the broken pieces of the orb. Sirius gets to his feet and sprints to Harry and
               Neville. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#SIRIUS">Get out of here, you two! He points at one of the doors. </sp>
         <sp who="#SIRIUS">That will take you back out of the Department of Mysteries. Sirius makes
            to go back to the fight. Harry grabs his hand. </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">You come with us! Sirius shakes his head. </sp>
         <sp who="#SIRIUS">You're the important one, now, Harry. I have to help the Order.<stage>
               Slowly, Harry lets go of Sirius's robe sleeve. He looks into his Godfather's eyes.
            </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#SIRIUS">I'll always be here for you, Harry. Now go!<stage> He pushes Harry away
               from him towards the door. A spell rockets past Sirius's head. Bellatrix leaps down
               in front of Sirius. She smiles. Sirius grins. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#SIRIUS">Hello, cousin!<stage> He fires a spell at her. She dodges, leaping down
               to the Dais on which the Veil sits. Sirius leaps after. Their wands clash, blinding
               lights exploding from the tips. Harry and Neville climb towards the door.
            </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#LUCIUS">Potter!<stage> They whirl around to find Lucius only feet away, holding
               his wand out at them. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#LUCIUS">We may have lost the prophesy, but I can still deliver you to the Dark
            Lord! He waves his wand. </sp>
         <sp who="#LUCIUS">Stupify!<stage> Harry raises his own. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">Protego! Malfoy's spell bounces away from Harry.<stage> The door opens and
               Dumbledore, EYES BLAZING, enters, his wand at the ready. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#NEVILLE">It's Dumbledore!<stage> Malfoy attempts to run, but Dumbledore snaps his
               wand out, and Malfoy is knocked over and dragged back. Dumbledore moves past Harry
               and Neville, descending into what appears to be a war zone. He reaches the fight
               before the Death Eaters even know he's there. Dumbledore blasts two of them across
               the room before the rest notice. They break for the exits, but members of the Order
               are already there, stunning them. Bellatrix fires a stunning spell. Sirius ducks
               under it, laughing. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#SIRIUS">Is that the best you've got, cousin?<stage> He doesn't even see it
               coming. He's barely finished his sentence when the second spell strikes him in the
               chest. He is lifted up into the air, a look of shock upon his face. Time seems to
               slow for Harry as he watches Sirius's descent. And then Sirius falls into the Veil,
               his body simply falling behind it. He does not reappear on the other side. Harry
               sprints for his Godfather, but he seems to move in slow motion. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">
            <stage>screaming</stage> Sirius!<stage> He leaps down towards the Veil, abandoning
               everything. Tears are streaming down his face. His wand drifts from his grasp and
               clatters behind him. He leaps to the lowest level and charges up to the DAIS. Lupin
               reaches out and grabs him, holding him fast. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">
            <stage>screaming</stage> Let me go! He hits at Lupin, trying to break away from him. </sp>
         <sp who="#LUPIN">Harry! HARRY!...he's gone...there's nothing you can do... Harry hits him
            across the face, still struggling wildly. </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">LIAR!</sp>
         <stage> Things seem to slow down. All sound dies away for Harry. Spells flash and explode
            all around, bathing the room in strange colors, mixing with the light of the blue
            candles. But Harry's legs simply give out and he slumps against Lupin, who is also
            weeping. Harry clenches and unclenches his fists in agony, beating them weakly against
            Lupin's chest. </stage>
         <sp who="#HARRY">No...no...no....<stage> Lupin bodily picks Harry up, still weeping, and
               carries him away from the Dais. He lets go of Harry and turns to help Neville. Harry
               stands, dumbfounded beside him, still staring at the Veil. Kingsley leaps up to duel
               with Bellatrix, but she blasts him aside. Dumbledore turns and attempts to stop her,
               but she deflects the spell and leaps towards the door. Harry watches her, and there
               is COLD FURY in his eyes. Harry sprints after her. Lupin turns to see him leaping up
               after Bellatrix. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#LUPIN">Harry, no!<stage> He flies through the door after her. </stage></sp>

         <sp who="#HARRY">Stupify!<stage> Bellatrix turns and deflects it. She fires back at him.
               Harry dives behind the fountain. There is silence. Then, the slow footfalls of
               Bellatrix. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#BELLATRIX">Come out, come out, Potter... Harry grows more angry by the second. </sp>
         <sp who="#BELLATRIX">Well, well, have you come to avenge your dear Godfather? Harry leaps
            out from behind the fountain. </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">Crucio!<stage> He hits her squarely in the chest. She SHRIEKS in pain and

         <sp who="#BELLATRIX">Crucio!<stage> Harry leaps behind the statue of the Centaur.
               Bellatrix's spell blasts the Centaur's head off. It clangs away into the darkness.

         <sp who="#BELLATRIX">Forgive me, Master! I tried, I-- Harry laughs again. </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">He can't hear you from here, you know! </sp>
         <sp who="#VOLDEMORT">Can't I, Potter?<stage> Voldemort has appeared in the middle of the
               hall, his wand pointed at Harry. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#VOLDEMORT">So, you smashed my prophesy...<stage> Harry doesn't move, frozen into
               stillness by the horror. Voldemort sneers. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#VOLDEMORT">I grow tired of you continually thwarting my plans, Harry Potter! He
            snaps his wand down. </sp>
         <sp who="#VOLDEMORT">Avada Kadavra!<stage> Green light EXPLODES from his wand. Harry
               flinches, but the statue of the GOLDEN WIZARD leaps down from the fountain and takes
               the blast full in the chest. It explodes in a thousand shards of molten metal.
               Voldemort whirls. Dumbledore stands at the doorway, looking ferocious, his BLUE EYES
               BLAZING. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE">You should not have come here tonight, Tom. </sp>
         <sp who="#VOLDEMORT">It is you who made that mistake, Dumbledore!<stage> He slashes with
               his wand. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#VOLDEMORT">Avada Kedavra!<stage> Dumbledore VANISHES with a swirl of his cloak
               and reappears between Voldemort and Bellatrix. She tries to run, but Dumbledore
               knocks her to the ground with a stunning spell, vanishing again just as another
               KILLING CURSE strikes the wall and explodes, shaking the hall. He reappears close to
               Voldemort. Dumbledore raises his wand and strikes. A BLINDING LIGHT issues forth from
               it, the POWER of it staggering. Voldemort conjures a GLOWING, TRANSLUCENT SHIELD
               around himself. Dumbledore's spell COLLIDES with it, filling the room completely with
               BLINDING LIGHT. The whole room shakes. Harry staggers to the ground. Bits of dust and
               rock fall from the walls. The light fades and Voldemort is unharmed. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#VOLDEMORT">You do not seek to kill me, Dumbledore? </sp>
         <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE">There are other ways to destroy a man, Tom. </sp>
         <sp who="#VOLDEMORT">There is nothing worse than death! </sp>
         <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE">You are quite wrong, Tom, as you have always been.<stage> Voldemort
               fires another killing curse at Dumbledore. Fawkes the Phoeniz swoops down from above
               and SWALLOWS the jet of green light, EXPLODING into flames and falling to the earth.
               Dumbledore spins, sending a constant flow of BLINDING LIGHT BLASTING from his wand,
               the sheer POWER of it SHAKING the HALL. Voldemort raises his own wand, and the LIGHT
               separates around him. Dumbledore and Voldemort are SURROUNDED by the flow of LIGHT.
               Dumbledore grits his teeth as a high wind BILLOWS his CLOAK around him. Voldemort
               glares at Dumbledore, EYES BLOOD-RED. His wand trembles in his hand, and Voldemort is
               slowly being forced backward by the power of the STREAM of LIGHT. Fear flickers in
               Voldemort's eyes. He lets out a ROAR of frustration. A ring of GREEN FLAME surrounds
               him, and he vanishes in a TONGUE of RED-ORANGE FIRE. Dumbledore's stream of LIGHT
               BLASTS into the wall and PUNCHES a HUGE, GAPING HOLE in the wall, shaking the whole
               Ministry. Harry is lifted bodily into the air and tossed into the wall from the
               explosion. There is a sharp CRACK of rock BREAKING, and half of the ceiling falls in.
               Dumbledore whips around his wand and Harry is pulled from under the falling rocks.
               Voldemort reappears on the PILINTH where the statues had been. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">Look out!<stage> He raised his wand, shouting a spell. The water in the
               pool below the statues instantly flow upward to surround Voldemort in a globe of
               water. Voldemort vanishes from within the globe of water, and it crashes back down to
               the pool, spilling over onto the floor. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">Professor! He stands up. </sp>
         <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE">Stay where you are, Harry! Dumbledore sounds frightened.<stage> Then
               Harry SCREAMS. His scar simply SPLITS open and BLOOD SPIRTS from it. He shrieks in
               agony, the pain unbearable. Harry speaks, but it is not his voice. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY #VOLDEMORT"> Kill me now, Dumbledore...do it, if death means
               nothing...<stage> Green flames explode from all of the fireplaces around them, and
               people appear as they APPERATE. Cornelius Fudge arrives too. Voldemort shrieks in
               pain, and he appears across the room. He snatches up the unconscious body of
               Bellatrix and DISSAPARATES in a blast of GREEN FIRE. Harry slumps to the ground. His
               eyes are closed, his face peaceful. Blood flows from his scar across his face to the
               ground. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE">Harry!<stage> He runs to Harry's side and touches his skin. He closes
               his eyes and whispers a spell. Harry's eyes snap open. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE">Are you all right, Harry? Harry nods, dazed. </sp>
         <sp who="#PERCY">Minister, I saw him! You-Know-Who! He was right there!<stage> Fudge is
               standing in the middle of the room, a dazed look also on his face. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#FUDGE">I know...I saw him too...<stage> Dumbledore stands. Half the room gasps
               and draws back. Fudge seems to notice him for the first time. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE">If you and your men will proceed to the Death Room, you will find
            several Death Eaters which I and some others have apprehended. Fudge points at
            Dumbledore. </sp>
         <sp who="#FUDGE">Seize him!<stage> Dumbledore stands to his full height, his eyes BLAZING
               with ANGER. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE">Minister, you have just seen You- Know-Who in the flesh only seconds
            ago! It is time to come to your senses! Fudge looks cowed. </sp>
         <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE">If you insist on trying to arrest me, I am perfectly willing
            demonstrate how useless such an attempt will be.<stage> No one looks remotely interested
               in trying to arrest Dumbledore. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#FUDGE">Dumbledore, what the blazes happened here?<stage> Dumbledore smiles, and
               walks back over to Harry, lifting him to his feet. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE">I will explain everything, Minister. Just as soon as I return Harry
            to school. Fudge <stage>and half the crowd</stage> turns to see Harry for the first
            time. </sp>
         <sp who="#FUDGE">What's he doing here? And what's happened to him?<stage> Dumbledore taps
               his wand against Harry's scar and the bleeding stops. He turns to the Minister of
               Magic. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE">Minister, you will order the removal of Dolores Umbridge from my
            school. <stage>pause</stage> Also, she will probably need medical attention, having had
            a violent encounter with some Centaurs earlier this evening. <stage>pause</stage>

         </sp>
         <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE"><stage>cont'd</stage> All Educational Decrees will be nullified and

            incomprehensibly. </sp>
         <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE">I will return here later tonight, after I have seen to Harry. It
            should not take long. He taps the Golden centaur head. </sp>
         <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE">Portus. He motions Harry over. </sp>
         <sp who="#FUDGE">Dumbledore, I want some answers! </sp>

         <stage cat="INT" where="DUMBLEDORE'S  OFFICE  -  NIGHT"> Harry and Dumbledore reappear in
            his office. There are shouts of welcome from the portraits. </stage>
         <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE">Thank you...<stage> He takes a small baby Phoenix from his pocket and
               places it on Fawkes' stand. Dumbledore's desk has been repaired, and the Pensive
               rests upon it. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE">Please sit, Harry.<stage> Harry is staring at him, bitterness and
               sorrow evident on his face. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE">I understand how you feel, Harry-- </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">No you don't!<stage> Dumbledore looks hard at him. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE">You forget that Sirius was my friend too. You are not the only person
            on this earth capable of feelings, Harry. Harry nearly snarls at him. </sp>
         <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE">There is no shame in feeling pain, Harry. It is your greatest
            strength... </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">You don't have a clue! You can't possibly know! </sp>
         <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE">What can't I know?<stage> Harry grabs an instrument from one of the
               tables and throws it across the room. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE">This pain is part of being human, Harry... </sp>

         <sp who="#HARRY">I don't care! I don't care!<stage> He begins to silently weep, tears
               pouring down his face. He throws over another table and falls to his knees.
            </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE">You do care. You care so much you feel like you will bleed to death
            because of it. Harry gets to his feet.<stage> Harry turns and moves to the door. He
               yanks on the handle. The door will not open. He looks at Dumbledore. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">Let me out. </sp>
         <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE">No. Harry draws his wand, looking furious. </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">You can't keep me in here! </sp>
         <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE">I daresay I can. And if you actually do attack me with that wand,
            Harry, I'm afraid to say you will regret it.<stage> Harry is silent, breathing hard and
               glaring at Dumbledore. The Headmaster indicates the chair in front of his desk. Harry
               finally sits, looking sulky. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE">It is my fault Sirius died tonight. <stage>pause</stage> I have kept
            things from you, Harry. Things that I should not have concealed. You had a right to
            know, but I put off telling you. Dumbledore sighs, sadly, and suddenly he seems very
            old. </sp>
         <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE">Had I told you that Voldemort might try to lure you down to the
            Department of Mysteries you would never have gone there tonight. Sirius would never have
            gone after you. <stage>pause</stage> That fault lies with me. I hope that you can find
            it in your heart to forgive me one day. Harry stares angrily out the window. </sp>
         <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE">Harry, I owe you this explanation, to show you the failings of an old
            man. Harry continues staring out the window. </sp>
         <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE">Our explanation begins with your scar. You already know that it is a
            connection between you and Voldemort, and that this connection goes both ways.
               <stage>pause</stage> I grew worried that Voldemort would at some point discover this
            connection, which he did the night Mr. Weasely was attacked. </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">I already know all this. </sp>
         <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE">Haven't you wondered why I haven't spoken to you, even looked at you,
            for months? </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">Well, yeah, I did... </sp>
         <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE">I was worried that if Voldemort discovered there was a closer
            relationship between us than simply between teacher and student he would use you to spy
            on the Order. Another mistake. <stage>pause</stage> Voldemort showed us both tonight
            that his aim in possessing you would not be to destroy me, but to destroy you. Harry
            looks at his shoes. </sp>
         <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE">Sirius told me you believed there was a snake inside of you. This was
            Voldemort attempting to manipulate you. To protect you from this, I had you study
            Occlumency. </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">But Snape stopped giving me lessons. </sp>
         <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE">Yes. I thought he could overcome his feelings towards your father,
            but I was wrong. Some wounds cut too deep to be healed. </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">He barely taught me, though. I always felt more open to it after the
            lessons. Like he was trying to open me to Voldemort-- </sp>
         <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE">I would trust Severus Snape with my life, Harry. You have never
            recovered from your mistrust of him in your first year. </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">Sirius didn't trust him. Didn't believe he'd really turned to our side... </sp>
         <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE">Again, some wounds run too deep to be healed, Harry. Severus and
            Sirius never liked each other at school. This has never changed. Harry glares at the
            carpet. </sp>
         <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE">During your Occulumency lessons, Professor Snape discovered that you
            were dreaming about the door in the Department of Mysteries. </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">I've been dreaming about that all year, before Voldemort discovered the
            connection. </sp>
         <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE">Yes. Voldemort has been obsessed with hearing that prophesy since he
            returned. Because of your scar, what he was obsessed with, you were obsessed with, in
            the form of dreams. <stage>pause</stage>
            <stage>MORE</stage>
         </sp>
         <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE"><stage>cont'd</stage> Once he discovered the connection, Voldemort had
            little difficulty in manipulating you into thinking he had captured Sirius. </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">But I checked Grimmauld Place! Kreacher said-- </sp>
         <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE">Kreacher lied. He wanted you to go to the Department of Mysteries. </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">Why? </sp>
         <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE">Kreacher has been serving two masters for some months now. </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">What? </sp>
         <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE">It appears that when Sirius told him to get out, Kreacher thought he
            meant out of the house. So he went to the Black's closest relatives, the Malfoys.
               <stage>pause</stage> Obviously, they questioned him. Sirius had forbidden him from
            giving up important secrets. But Sirius had neglected to mention his relationship with
            you. <stage>pause</stage> He told them how you saw him as a mixture of father and
            brother, and that you would move heaven and earth to save Sirius. <stage>pause</stage>
            Voldemort knew that making you believe he had Sirius in the Department of Mysteries
            would force you there. </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">Wait, where was Sirius when I tried to contact him? </sp>
         <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE">Ah. Apparently Kreacher had injured Buckbeak to distract him in case
            you tried to contact Headquarters. <stage>MORE</stage>
         </sp>
         <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE"><stage>cont'd</stage> Sirius was tending to the wounds when you
            called. </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">And Hermione said we should be nice to Kreacher! </sp>
         <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE">She was quite right, Harry. Kreacher is what wizards have made him.
            He is to be pitied, not hated. </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">Sirius hated him. </sp>
         <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE">He didn't hate Kreacher himself. Kreacher was a reminder to Sirius of
            the home he had always hated. </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">Yeah, he really hated that place. And you kept him locked up in there! </sp>
         <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE">I was trying to save his life!<stage> Dumbledore buries his head in
               his hands. Harry is dumbfounded. The Headmaster looks up finally. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE">It is time to tell you what I should have five years ago. No doubt
            you have wondered why it was that I sent you there and not to a wizarding family?
               <stage>pause</stage> I did it for your protection. You were in more danger than
            anyone realized. Voldemort was defeated, but his servants were everywhere. Harry is
            silent. </sp>
         <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE">I also knew that Voldemort would return one day. I played to his
            weakness. There is an ancient magic which Voldemort has always underestimated.

         </sp>
         <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE"><stage>cont'd</stage> This magic is what your mother gave you when she

         <sp who="#HARRY">She never loved me. </sp>
         <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE">Perhaps not. But she took you in, however grudgingly. As long as you

         <sp who="#HARRY">I asked you why Voldemort tried to kill me. </sp>
         <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE">Yes. I decided not to tell you then. After all, eleven was too young
            for such burdens. The same went for twelve. But I was running out of excuses by thirteen
            and fourteen. Do you see the flaw in my plan yet? Harry shakes his head. </sp>
         <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE">I cared about you too much. I became more concerned with your
            happiness and well-being than with the truth and the lives it could save. That was my
            greatest mistake. It was exactly what Voldemort expects from us fools who love.
               <stage>pause</stage> But I could not bear to tell you. I have watched you pass
            through greater trials than any other student in the history of this school, and I could
            not bear to add another one, the greatest one of all. He looks at Harry, sympathy and
            regret etched on his face. </sp>
         <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE">You have no idea the pain it causes me to tell it to you, even now.
            But unfortunately, I must. </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">I don't understand, Professor. Dumbledore sighs again. </sp>
         <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE">The reason Voldemort tried to kill you is because of a prophesy made
            just before your birth. By attempting to kill you, he believed he was fulfilling the
            terms of the prophesy. Voldemort's mistake was that he had not heard the entire
            prophesy. <stage>pause</stage> That is the weapon we have been guarding, and which he
            has been so desperately seeking: the knowledge of how to destroy you. Harry sighs this
            time. He looks at the floor. </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">Professor, why am I so important to him? Harry hangs his head. </sp>
         <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE">An excellent question, Harry. The answer lies in the prophesy. </sp>

               Dumbledore raises his wand to his temple and extracts a memory, placing it in the

            Month dies..." The image of Trelawney fades. Harry looks staggered. </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">I'm not sure I understand all that, sir... </sp>
         <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE">It means that the only person with a chance of defeating Voldemort
            was born at the end of July to parents who had resisted him three times before. </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">And...it means me? </sp>
         <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE">Interestingly, there were two boys whom the prophesy could have been
            referring to. You and Neville Longbottom. </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">So it's not necessarily me, sir? </sp>
         <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE">You forget the next qualification of the prophesy. The Dark Lord will
            mark this boy as his equal. <stage>pause</stage> In giving you that scar, Voldemort did
            so. I'm afraid that the prophesy is most certainly referring to you. </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">What if he chose wrong? </sp>
         <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE">He chose the child he believed to be the more dangerous. He chose the
            "half-blood" wizard because he saw some of himself in you. <stage>pause</stage> He tried
            to kill you and instead gave you the power and the future to destroy him. </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">Why didn't he wait? Why attack when we were babies? </sp>
         <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE">Voldemort had an informant listening to my meeting with Professor
            Trelawney. Fortunately he was discovered before he could hear the entire prophesy.
            Voldemort had to act immediately, he didn't know the rest of the prophesy. All he knew
            was that he had to destroy the child who would grow to be a threat to his power. </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">But I don't have any special powers. Dumbledore is silent for a moment. </sp>
         <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE">There is a room in the Department of Mysteries which is kept locked
            at all times. It contains a force so wonderful and yet terrible that it is greater than
            death itself. It is that power which you have incredible amounts of and of which
            Voldemort has none. </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">What is it, sir? </sp>
         <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE">This power drove you to save Sirius tonight. It kept Voldemort from
            possessing you, he cannot bear to touch it. <stage>pause</stage> In the end, it was your
            heart and not your head that saved you. Harry looks away. </sp>
         <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE">There is only the end of the prophesy which we haven't addressed. It
            states "neither can live while the other survives." Harry slowly looks up at Dumbledore. </sp>
         <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE">It is the final burden which I must place on you, Harry. </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">One of us has to kill the other...in the end. Dumbledore nods, and there
            are tears misting his eyes. </sp>
         <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE">Yes.<stage> They sit quietly together. Dumbledore softly wipes a tear
               from his cheek. </stage></sp>

      <scene>
         <stage cat="EXT" where="GREAT  LAKE  -  DAY"> Harry sits by himself on a boulder by the
            side of the lake. He watches the sunset. </stage>
         <sp who="#NEARLYHEADLESSNICK"> Hello, Harry.<stage> Harry turns to see NEARLY-HEADLESS NICK,
               a GHOST, standing beside him. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">Hey, Nick.<stage> Nick looks uncomfortable. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#NEARLYHEADLESSNICK"> I--Well, Madam Pomfrey asked me to tell you that Hermione and
            Ron are out of the hospital wing. </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">Oh. Thanks. He stands and they begin to walk back to the castle together. </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">Nick, I was wondering about something? Nick looks even more uncomfortable
            now. </sp>
         <sp who="#NEARLYHEADLESSNICK"> I've been expecting this... </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">Expecting what? </sp>
         <sp who="#NEARLYHEADLESSNICK"> A lot of people come to me when they've lost loved ones. </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">I expect so... There is a silence. </sp>
         <sp who="#NEARLYHEADLESSNICK"> He's not coming back, Harry. There is another silence. </sp>
         <sp who="#NEARLYHEADLESSNICK"> Few wizards choose the path I have chosen. </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">Why? </sp>
         <sp who="#NEARLYHEADLESSNICK"> I am neither here nor there, Harry. Trapped between two
            worlds. That does not appeal to most. <stage>pause</stage> I know nothing of the secrets
            of death, Harry. I was afraid of it. I preferred to survive as a feeble imitation of
            life than face the vast unknown. <stage>pause</stage> I often wonder if that was a wise
            decision. They approach the great doors leading to the entry hall. Nick looks at Harry. </sp>
         <sp who="#NEARLYHEADLESSNICK"> I'm sorry I couldn't be of more help, Harry. Truly I
               am.<stage> Nick vanishes through the wall into the castle. Harry steps through the
               doors into the entry hall. </stage></sp>

      <scene>
         <stage cat="INT" where="ENTRY  HALL  -  DAY"> Harry enters. </stage>
         <sp who="#HERMIONE">Harry!<stage> He turns to see Hermione and Ron racing down the steps
               towards him. Hermione throws herself into Harry's arms in a huge bear hug.
            </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">How are you? </sp>
         <sp who="#RON">Good as new, mate.<stage> Hermione pulls herself away from Harry and looks
               at him closely. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#HERMIONE"><stage>quietly</stage> How are you doing, Harry? Harry pauses for a
            long moment, thinking.<stage> Better. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY"> </sp>
         <sp who="#HERMIONE"> Come on, let's go in to the feast. Harry shakes his head. </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">You two go on. I want to be alone for a while.<stage> Hermione nods. They
               turn away and begin to walk into the great hall. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">I've got something to tell you. Something important. They stop and look at
            him again. </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">But not right now. I'm not ready. </sp>
         <sp who="#HERMIONE">Take your time, Harry. We'll be here when you are.<stage> She smiles at
               him. Ron and Hermione disappear into the great hall. Luna comes down the stairs
               carrying a stack of papers. She goes up to the NOTICE BOARD and attaches one of the
               papers to it. She turns and sees Harry. </stage></sp>
         <sp who="#LUNA">Hello, Harry. He walks up to her. </sp>
         <sp who="#LUNA">It's the last night and I need to pack. </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">Then why are you putting up signs? </sp>
         <sp who="#LUNA">Oh, people take my things and hide them. <stage>MORE</stage>
         </sp>
         <sp who="#LUNA"><stage>cont'd</stage> I don't think they like me much. Some of them call me
            "Loony" Lovegood. Harry looks at her in pity. </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">Do you need any help looking? </sp>
         <sp who="#LUNA">Oh no. It all turns up in the end. She looks at him serenely. </sp>
         <sp who="#LUNA">Sirius Black. Hermione said he was your Godfather. </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">Yeah. <stage>pause</stage> Have you ever...you know... </sp>
         <sp who="#LUNA">My mother. I was nine. </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">I'm sorry. </sp>
         <sp who="#LUNA">It's okay. It's not like I'll never see her again. </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">Isn't it? </sp>
         <sp who="#LUNA">Don't tell me you didn't hear them. The voices beyond the Veil? Harry looks
            startled. </sp>
         <sp who="#LUNA">They were just out of sight, that's all. </sp>
         <sp who="#HARRY">You mean we'll see them again? </sp>
         <sp who="#LUNA">Of course. <stage>pause</stage> Things always work out, in the end.<stage>
               She smiles at him. Then she heads back up the stairs and into the feast. Harry is
               left alone in the entry hall. He turns and looks into the glorious sunset. For the
               first time in a long time, Harry smiles too. FADE OUT</stage></sp>
