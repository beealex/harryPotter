  <scene>
   <stage cat="EXT" where=" PRIVET DRIVE NIGHT "> Dark at this hour, except for the STREET LAMPS
    that dot the street, spilling deep pools of light upon the ground. On the far corner, a MAN
    MATERIALIZES out of the darkness. He is tall and thin, with a silver beard long enough to tuck
    into his belt. He wears a PURPLE CLOAK and is roughly one hundred and fifty years old. He is
    ALBUS DUMBLEDORE. Dumbledore removes a small silver object from his cloak-the PUT-OUTER. He
    extends his hand and--CLICK--the nearest street lamp GOES OUT with a soft pop. He continues to
    click the Put-Outer until all the lamps go DARK. He turns, spies a CAT, sitting on the wall of
    Number Four. He smiles knowingly </stage>
   <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE"> I should have known you'd be here, Professor McGonagall.<stage> The cat
     leaps forward, TRANSFIGURES itself into a rather severe-looking woman in an EMERALD CLOAK.
    </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#MCGONAGALL"> Are the rumors true, Albus? </sp>
   <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE">
    <stage>(smile fading) </stage> I'm afraid so. The good. And the bad. </sp>
   <sp who="#MCGONAGALL "> And the boy? </sp>
   <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE "> Hagrid's bringing him. </sp>
   <sp who="#MCGONAGALL "> You think it ... wise ... to trust Hagrid with something as important as
    this? </sp>
   <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE "> I would trust Hagrid with my life, Professor. <stage> A LOW RUMBLE
     disturbs the skies. Dumbledore and McGonagall lookup and--suddenly--a HUGE MOTORCYCLE plummets
     through the clouds, hits the ground with a THUNDEROUS ROAR. As the SMOKE clears, a FIGURE
     climbs off. He is HAGRID and is, quite obviously, a GIANT. In his vast, muscular arms, he holds
     a BUNDLE of BLANKETS. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#HAGRID "> Ev'ning, Professor Dumbledore, sir. Professor McGonagall. </sp>
   <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE "> No problems, I take it, Hagrid? </sp>
   <sp who="#HAGRID "> No sir. Little tyke fell ter sleep as we was flyin' o'er Bristol . <stage>
     Hagrid steps forward and Dumbledore takes the bundle, turns toward the doorstep. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#MCGONAGALL "> Albus, do you really think it best to leave him here; with these people?
    I've been watching them all day. They're the worst sort of Muggles imaginable. They're ... </sp>
   <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE "> The only family he has. </sp>
   <sp who="#MCGONAGALL "> But this boy will be famous. There won't be a child in our world who
    doesn't know his name ... </sp>
   <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE "> Exactly. It would be enough to turn any boy's head. Famous before he can
    walk and talk. Famous for something he won't even remember. No. He'll be much better off growing
    up away from all that. Until he's ready. <stage> Dumbledore lays the bundle on the mat. Hagrid
     SNIFFLES. There, there, Hagrid. It' s not really goodbye, after all. Hagrid nods. Dumbledore
     tucks a PARCHMENT the ENVELOPE into blankets and steps back, his face suddenly dark. Serious.
     Good luck, Harry Potter. The CAMERA DOLLIES forward, toward the swaddled baby. A CUT, still
     fresh, gleams on the baby's forehead. It is in the shape of a BOLT of LIGHTNING. SMASH CUT TO
     TEN YEARS LATER. </stage></sp>
  </scene>
  <scene>
   <stage cat="INT" where=" CUPBOARD-NUMBER FOUR PRIVET DRIVE - MORNING "> A pair of blinking GREEN
    EYES jerk into the light. </stage>


   <sp who="#WOMAN'SVOICE">
    <stage>(O.S.) </stage> Up! Now! <stage>THUMP! THUMP! ! THUMP! </stage> I said now! </sp>

   <stage>FOOTSTEPS RECEDE and HARRY POTTER, now ten years old, swings his skinny legs to the floor.
    He's small, which is lucky since his room is not really a room at all, but merely a cupboard
    under the stairs . Abruptly, the cupboard begins to SHAKE, DUST spilling from the joists above
    Harry's head. Calmly, Harry takes a pair of EYEGLASSES--taped at the bridge with Sellotape--from
    a nail. </stage>

  </scene>
  <scene>
   <stage cat="EXT" where=" HALLWAY - DAY  "> Harry comes blinking out the cupboard door, watches
    his enormous cousin, DUDLEY, thunder down the last step. Just then, Harry's Aunt Petunia appears
    in the kitchen ahead. </stage>
   <sp who="#AUNT PETUNIA "> There's the birthday boy! Don't you look smart for your trip to the
    zoo. <stage>(scowling at Harry) </stage> You mind the bacon. And don't dare let it burn. I want
    everything perfect on my Dimplin' s special day . </sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY "> Yes, Aunt Petunia. </sp>
  </scene>
  <scene>
   <stage cat="INT" where=" KITCHEN - DAY  "> Harry enters, finds his UNCLE VERNON reading the Daily
    Mail behind a monstrous PILE OF PRESENTS. </stage>
   <sp who="#UNCLE VERNON "> Bring my coffee, boy. </sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY "> Yes, Uncle Vernon. <stage> Dudley enters, stares at the presents .
    </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#DUDLEY "> How many are there? </sp>
   <sp who="#UNCLE VERNON "> Thirty-six. Counted them myself. </sp>
   <sp who="#DUDLEY "> Thirty-six. But last year ... last year I had thirty-seven ... </sp>
   <sp who="#UNCLE VERNON "> Well now, son, some of these are quite a bit bigger than last year- </sp>
   <sp who="#DUDLEY "> I DON'T CARE HOW BIG THEY ARE! </sp>
   <sp who="#AUNT PETUNIA "> Now, now, here's what we'll do. Today, when we're out, we'll buy you
    two more presents. How's that, popkin? </sp>
   <sp who="#DUDLEY "> So then I 'll have ... I' ll have ... </sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY "> Thirty-eight, popkin. <stage> Aunt Petunia cuffs Harry on the head on her way
     to the RINGING TELEPHONE. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#AUNT PETUNIA "> You just mind that bacon! </sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY "> Yes, Aunt Petunia. <stage> As Dudley tears open a BOX of LEAD SOLDIERS, Uncle
     Vernon ruffles his hair. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#UNCLE VERNON "> Want your money's worth, don't you, tiger. Well, look there. Aunt
    Marge's sent you the Fourth Battalion. <stage> Dudley twists the head off one. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#DUDLEY "> This one's lost its head. </sp>
   <sp who="#UNCLE VERNON "> Well now, son. Remember, we talked about this. They're not meant to
    move ... <stage> As Dudley tosses the damaged soldier aside, Harry studies it closely, then ...
     Aunt Petunia HANGS UP the phone, turns. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#AUNT PETUNIA "> Bad news. Mrs. Figgs' broken her leg. She can't take him. </sp>
   <sp who="#UNCLE VERNON "> We could phone Yvonne. </sp>
   <sp who="#AUNT PETUNIA "> Don't be silly. She hates the boy. </sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY "> You could just leave me here. </sp>
   <sp who="#UNCLE VERNON "> And come back to find the house in ruins? </sp>
   <sp who="#DUDLEY "> I... Don't... Want... Him... To... Come! He... always... spoils...
    everything! </sp>
   <sp who="#AUNT PETUNIA "> Now, precious, don't cry. He won't spoil anything. What if Mummy buys
    you three more presents. </sp>
   <sp who="#DUDLEY "> Three? </sp>
   <sp who="#AUNT PETUNIA "> As many as you want, sweetums. <stage> As Aunt Petunia cuddles him,
     Dudley shoots Harry a nasty grin through the gap in his mother's arms. </stage></sp>
  </scene>
  <scene>
   <stage cat="EXT" where=" NUMBER FOUR PRIVET DRIVE - A BIT LATER "> As Harry gets in the car,
    Uncle Vernon leans close. </stage>
   <sp who="#UNCLE VERNON "> I'm warning you now, boy. Any funny business, any at all, and you'll
    have no meals for a week. </sp>
  </scene>
  <scene>
   <stage cat="EXT" where=" ZOO - DAY "> Happy children walk hand in hand with their parents, as...
   </stage>
  </scene>
  <scene>
   <stage cat="INT" where=" REPTILE HOUSE... LATER - DAY "> Dudley presses his pudgy nose to a
    gleaming plate of glass </stage>
   <sp who="#DUDLEY "> Make it move. <stage> Uncle Vernon looks over a zoo map at the HUGE BURMESE
     PYTHON curled beyond the glass. RAPS his knuckles. Nothing. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY "> He's asleep. </sp>
   <sp who="#DUDLEY "> He's boring.Â· Dudley waddles away and the others follow, all but Harry, who
    steps forward and rubs Dudley's nose print from the glass. </sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY "> Sorry about him. He doesn't understand what it's like, lying there day after
    day, watching people press their ugly faces in on you... <stage>The snake nods. Harry stops,
     looks off, then back. WHISPERS: </stage> Can you hear me? <stage>The snake cocks its head
     and... winks. </stage> It's just, I've never talked to a snake before. Do you, I mean... do you
    talk to people often? <stage>The snake regards Harry ... then slowly shakes its head no. Harry
     nods, looking a bit unnerved. </stage> So ... you're from Burma, aren't you? Was it nice there?
    Do you miss your family? <stage>(listening) </stage> I see. That's me as well. I never knew my
    parents either... </sp>
   <sp who="#DUDLEY "> MUMMY! DAD! COME HERE! You won't what this snake is doing! <stage> Dudley
     JABS Harry hard in the ribs, sending him tumbling to the concrete floor. Angry, Harry looks up
     as Dudley leans against the glass and it... VANISHES. Dudley flops forward, the snake slithers
     out, and people run screaming. Stunned, Harry watches the python slip into the sunshine, then
     glances back to the snake tank. The glass has reappeared and Dudley sits within, face pale,
     eyes frozen in terror. </stage></sp>
  </scene>
  <scene>
   <stage cat="INT" where=" NUMBERFOUR PRIVET DRIVE - LATER DAY "> Uncle Vernon, face purple with
    rage, drags Harry by the ear. </stage>
   <sp who="#HARRY "> I swear, I don't know how it happened! One minute the glass was there and then
    it was gone. It was like magic. <stage> Uncle Vernon hurls Harry into the cupboard, stares hard.
    </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#UNCLEVERNON "> There's... no ... such... thing... as... magic! <stage> The door SLAMS.
     Harry sits quietly. Then, from his pocket, he removes the damaged soldier Dudley had discarded
     earlier. Reaching up, he places it on a dark shelf, next to half a dozen others. </stage></sp>
  </scene>
  <scene>
   <stage cat="EXT" where=" NUMBERFOUR PRIVET DRIVE MORNING "> A single OWL swoops down onto the
    Dursley's roof. </stage>
  </scene>
  <scene>
   <stage cat="INT" where=" KITCHEN MORNING "> Dudley parades about the kitchen in knickerbockers,
    tailcoat and straw boater, tapping the floor with a KNOBBLY STICK, while a teary Aunt Petunia
    snaps a photo with a FLASH CAMERA. </stage>
   <sp who="#AUNTPETUNIA "> Oh, Vernon, look at him. To think in only a week he'll be off to
    Smeltings. </sp>
   <sp who="#UNCLEVERNON "> Proudest moment of my life. </sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY ">
    <stage>(with dread) </stage> Will I have to wear that too? </sp>
   <sp who="#AUNTPETUNIA "> You! Go to Smeltings? Don't be stupid. You'll go to state school, where
    you belong. That there'll be yours, once I'm done dying it. <stage> Harry glances at a tub of
     grey mud boiling on the stove. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY "> But that's Dudley's old uniform. It'll fit me like bits of old elephant skin. </sp>
   <sp who="#AUNTPETUNIA  "> Fit you fine enough. Now fetch the post. </sp>
  </scene>
  <scene>
   <stage cat="INT" where=" FRONTHALL- DAY  "> Three letters lie on the mat. A bill. A postcard. An
    envelope of YELLOW PARCHMENT. Harry takes all, then stops, staring at the envelope, which is
    addressed in EMERALD INK. Mr. H. Potter The Cupboard Under The Stairs 4 Privet Drive Little
    Whinging Surrey Harry turns the envelope over, finds a PURPLE WAX SEAL. It is a COAT OF ARMS,
    surrounding a large letter H. </stage>
  </scene>
  <scene>
   <stage cat="INT" where=" KITCHEN - DAY  "> Harry drops the post on the table and sits, staring in
    quiet wonderment at his envelope. Uncle Vernon takes the postcard. </stage>
   <sp who="#UNCLE VERNON "> Marge's ill. Ate a funny whelk ... <stage> BAM! Dudley brings the
     Smelting stick down hard on the table . </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#DUDLEY "> Dad! Look! Harry's got a letter! <stage> Quickly, Uncle Vernon SNATCHES it
     away. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY "> That's mine! </sp>
   <sp who="#UNCLE VERNON "> Yours. Who'd be writing to you-<stage> Uncle Vernon's face goes pale.
    </stage></sp>
  </scene>
  <scene>
   <stage cat="INT" where=" HALLWAY- DAY "> The boys come flying into the hall, throw themselves
    against the door as it slams shut. </stage>
   <sp who="#HARRY "> I want my letter! </sp>
   <sp who="#DUDLEY "> I want my stick! <stage> Harry and Dudley make a furious play for the
     keyhole, but Dudley's size proves too much and Harry, glasses dangling from one ear, settles
     for the crack between door and floor. HARRY'S POV of Uncle Vernon's thick black shoes pacing
     back and forth. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#AUNTPETUNIA "> Vernon. Look at the address. How could they possibly know where he
    sleeps? You don't think they're watching the house? </sp>
   <sp who="#UNCLEVERNON "> Watching. Spying. Following us. We both know the dangerous nonsense your
    sister and her husband were mixed up in. </sp>
   <sp who="#AUNTPETUNIA "> But what should we do, Vernon? Should we write back. Tell them we don't
    want- </sp>
   <sp who="#UNCLEVERNON "> No. We'll ignore it. If they don't get an answer... Yes, that's best...
    I'll burn it. </sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY "> NO! I WANT MY LETTER! <stage> Uncle Vernon walks to the stove, flips on a gas
     jet. As the letter BURNS, Harry POUNDS the door, and a MONTAGE BEGINS: </stage></sp>
  </scene>
  <scene>
   <stage cat="EXT" where=" ROOF - NUMBER FOUR PRIVET DRIVE - MORNING "> An OWL beats its way across
    the sky, flutters down upon the TV ANTENNA, where TWO . OTHER OWLS already sit. </stage>
  </scene>
  <scene>
   <stage cat="INT" where=" LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME"> A frowning Uncle Vernon stands before the
    TELLY, struggling to unscramble a RUGBY MATCH. The CLICK of the MAIL SLOT is heard and he turns.
   </stage>
  </scene>
  <scene>
   <stage cat="INT" where=" FRONT HALL - DAY "> THREE MORE LETTERS lie on the mat. Uncle Vernon
    enters, snatches them up, RIPS them to pieces. </stage>
  </scene>
  <scene>
   <stage cat="INT" where=" CUPBOARD - DAY "> Harry sits sadly upon his bed, when ... BANG! BANG!
    BANG! </stage>
  </scene>
  <scene>
   <stage cat="INT" where=" FRONT HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER "> Harry eases open the cupboard door.
    Down the hallway, Uncle Vernon stands swinging a hammer, mouth bulging with-nails as he POUNDS
    SHUT the mail slot. </stage>
  </scene>
  <scene>
   <stage cat="EXT" where=" NUMBERFOUR PRIVET DRIVE - MORNING "> Uncle Vernon exits the house with
    his briefcase, stops. FOUR OWLS sit atop his Vauxhall. He watches curiously as they take flight,
    then looks down. FOUR LETTERS lie at his feet. </stage>
  </scene>
  <scene>
   <stage cat="INT" where=" LIVING ROOM - NIGHT "> The FIREPLACE BLAZES. Uncle Vernon pitches a
    handful of LETTERS into the flames, turns. Harry stands watching. </stage>
  </scene>
  <scene>
   <stage cat="EXT" where=" ROOF - NUMBER FOUR PRIVET DRIVE - SAME TIME "> As the CHIMNEY SMOKES,
    FIVE OWLS sit in black silhouette against a full moon. </stage>
  </scene>
  <scene>
   <stage cat="EXT" where=" KITCHEN WINDOW - NUMBER FOUR PRIVET DRIVE - MORNING "> Aunt Petunia
    cracks an EGG. Inside is a LETTER. She cracks another. Another LETTER. We PAN off the window to
    Dudley' s neglected BICYCLE. Perched atop the handlebars, seat and tires are SIX OWLS. MONTAGE
    ENDS. </stage>
  </scene>
  <scene>
   <stage cat="INT" where=" LIVING ROOM - SUNDAY MORNING - DAY "> Dudley lies on the floor,
    destroying another birthday toy, as Aunt Petunia carefully sets a cup of coffee by Uncle Vernon,
    who sits in an armchair smiling strangely. </stage>
   <sp who="#UNCLE VERNON "> Fine day, Sunday. Best day of the week in my opinion. Know why I say
    that, Dudley? </sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY ">
    <stage>(entering)</stage> Because there's no post on Sundays. <stage> Uncle Vernon looks up
     brightly, but Harry's eyes are on the window behind him. Outside, the sky is DARK WITH OWLS.
    </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#UNCLE VERNON "> Right you are, Harry! No damn letters today! No sir. Not one blasted
    ... <stage> Just then, something WHIZZES DOWN the chimney and SMACKS Uncle Vernon flat on the
     back of the head. Seconds later another follows, and then another, until the living room is
     aflock with ... LETTERS. Harry leaps onto a table, trying to snag one, when Uncle Vernon seizes
     him by the waist . </stage></sp>
  </scene>
  <scene>
   <stage cat="INT" where=" HALLWAY - DAY"> As Uncle Vernon stumbles out, Harry shakes free of his
    grasp and stares dumbly: LETTERS swirl up and down the hall. </stage>
   <sp who="#DUDLEY "> Who on earth wants to talk to you this badly! <stage> A letter flutters on
     Harry's fingertips ... before Uncle Vernon sweeps it away, eyes crazed, SHOUTING CRAZILY:
    </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#UNCLE VERNON "> That does it! We're going away! Far away! Where they can't find us!
    Where they can't get to us! <stage> Dudley glances at his mother </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#DUDLEY "> Daddy's gone mad, hasn't he? </sp>
  </scene>
  <scene>
   <stage cat="EXT" where=" HUT ON THE ROCK - NIGHT "> A very sad-looking HUT sits perched upon a
    large ROCK far at sea. Wind whistles. The sea rages. </stage>
  </scene>
  <scene>
   <stage cat="INT" where=" HUT ON THE ROCK - NIGHT  "> Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia sleep on a
    lumpy bed in the hut's only bedroom. Dudley SNORES on a moth-eaten sofa. Harry lies on the bare
    floor beneath a ragged blanket. LIGHTNING FLASHES. As the room goes dark again, Harry studies
    the lighted dial of Dudley's watch. As it ticks toward midnight, Harry puts the last touches to
    a BIRTHDAY CAKE he's etched in the dust that layers the floor. </stage>
   <sp who="#HARRY "> Make a wish, Harry. <stage> Closing his eyes, he ... blows ... and the
     "flames" of dust scatter. Eyes still closed, Harry holds the wish when... BOOM! The DOOR
     SHUDDERS. HINGES squeal. A pin squirrels out of its housing. Falls to the floor. BOOM! Uncle
     Vernon comes sledding into the room in his socks, a RIFLE in hand, paper hanging by a string
     from the. barrel. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#UNCLE VERNON "> Who's there'? I warn you--I'm armed! <stage> SMASH! The door falls
     flat. An IMMENSE SILHOUETTE stands against the raging sea outside, identical to the beastly
     figure seen climbing the stairs in Godric's Hollow. He is HAGRID and is, rather obviously, a
     GIANT. Presently he is standing on the front door. Â· Â· </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#HAGRID "> Er, right. Sorry 'bout that ... <stage> Hagrid steps clear, takes the door,
     and fits it back into its frame. Glances at Dudley. Frowns. Mind, I haven't seen yeh since you
     was a baby, Harry, but yeh' re a bit more along than I woulda expected. 'Specially round the
     middle. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#DUDLEY ">
    <stage>(terrified)</stage> I'm not Harry. </sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY "> I am. <stage> Hagrid turns, watches Harry's face come into the light.
    </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#HAGRID "> Well now, course yeh are. </sp>
   <sp who="#UNCLE VERNON "> I demand that you leave at once, sir! You are breaking and entering! </sp>
   <sp who="#HAGRID "> Ah, dry up, Dursley, yeh great prune. <stage>Hagrid takes the rifle, knots it
     like a piece of licorice. </stage> Anyway, Harry. Got summat fer yeh. 'Fraid I mighta sat on it
    at some point, but 'magine it'll taste all right jus' the same... let's see now... got it here
    somewhere ... <stage>Hagrid rummages in his coat, removes: a kettle, frying pan, sausages, one
     PINK UMBRELLA and, finally, a squashed paper box containing a CHOCOLATE CAKE with "Happee
     Birthdae, Harry" scrawled in green icing. </stage> Baked it meself, words an' all. </sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY "> Thank you . </sp>
   <sp who="#HAGRID "> Well, it's not ev'ry day yer young man turns 'leven. <stage> Hagrid turns to
     the fireplace, gives the embers a poke with the pink umbrella. As they ROAR to life, he takes
     the frying pan, lobs in the sausages. Dudley perks up as they sizzle. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY "> Excuse me, but ... who are you? <stage> Harry stares blankly. Hagrid frowns.
    </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#HAGRID  "> Blimey, Harry, did yeh never wonder where yer parents learnt it all? </sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY "> Learned what? </sp>
   <sp who="#HAGRID "> What? DURSLEY!!! Do yeh mean ter tell me the boy knows nothin? <stage> Uncle
     Vernon stands mute. Hagrid simmers, then shakes his head and turns back to the fire. Harry, yer
     a wizard. For a moment, the hut is utterly silent. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY"> I'm a what? </sp>
   <sp who="#HAGRID "> A Wizard. And a thumpin' good 'un, I'd wager, once yeh've been trained up a
    bit. </sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY "> No. You've made a mistake. I ... I can't be a ... wizard. I mean ... I'm just
    ... Harry. Just Harry. </sp>
   <sp who="#HAGRID "> Tha' right. Tell me, Harry. Ever make somethin' strange 'appen? When yeh was
    scared maybe. Or angry? <stage> As Harry looks up in recognition, Hagrid slaps a soggy ENVELOPE
     into Harry's hand. Harry opens it, reads. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY "> 'Dear Mr. Potter, We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at
    Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry ... ' <stage> As Harry looks up, Hagrid winks, and
     takes a bite of sausage. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#UNCLEVERNON "> He'll not be going, I tell you! We swore when we took him in we'd put a
    stop to that rubbish! </sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY "> You knew? You knew I'm a ... a wizard? <stage> Aunt Petunia--looking
     furious--emerges from the shadows. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#AUNTPETUNIA "> Of course we knew! How could you not be, my dratted sister being what
    she was? Oh, mother and father were so proud when the letter came. A witch in the family. Isn't
    it wonderful. I was the only one who saw her for what she was ... a freak!
     <stage>(distastefully) </stage> Then she met that Potter and had you. I knew you'd be the same.
    Just as strange, just as abnormal. And then, if you please, she went and got herself blown up
    and we get landed with you- </sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY "> Blown up? You told me my parents died in a car crash. </sp>
   <sp who="#HAGRID "> CAR CRASH! A car crash kill Lily and James Potter? It's an outrage! A
    scandal! </sp>
   <sp who="#UNCLE VERNON "> HE'LL NOT BE GOING, I TELL YOU! </sp>
   <sp who="#HAGRID "> An' I s'ppose a great Muggle like yerself is gcin' ter stop him. </sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY "> Muggle? </sp>
   <sp who="#HAGRID "> Non-magic folk. <stage>(turning to Uncle Vernon)</stage> This boy's name's
    been down ever since he was born. He's off to the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in
    the world and he'll be under the greatest headmaster Hogwart's has ever known, Albus

    They've only got one good jump in them to begin with. <stage>Harry glances at the card in his
     hand. On it, there's a MAN with a crooked nose, long silver beard, and half-moon glasses.
     Underneath is a name: ALBUS DUMBLEDORE. </stage>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY "> I've gotten Dumbledore! </sp>
   <sp who="#RON "> I've about six of him. Trade you Scabbers though, if you get Agrippa or Ptolemy. </sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY ">
    <stage>(reading the back) </stage> Considered by many the greatest wizard of modern times,
    Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for his
    discovery of the 12 uses of dragon's blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas
    Flamel. Approximately one hundred and fifty years old, Professor Dumbledore enjoys chamber
    music, tenpin bowling, and...' <stage>(looking up) </stage> One hundred arid fifty years old? </sp>
   <sp who="#RON "> Thought he'd be older, did you? </sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY "> No-- I--Hey, he's gone. <stage> Harry holds up the card--now blank--to Ron,
     who only shrugs. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#RON"> Well, you can't expect him to hang around all day, can you? </sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY "> It's just, in the Muggle world, people stay put in photos. </sp>
   <sp who="#RON "> Really? They don't move at all? Weird! <stage>Just then, Scabbers SNORTS, falls
     back asleep. </stage> Pathetic, isn't it? Fred gave me a spell that's to turn him yellow. Want
    to see? <stage> Harry nods, eager to see some magic. Ron pulls out a BATTERED WAND--just as the
     compartment door OPENS and a GIRL with bushy brown hair and rather large front teeth looks in.
     She is HERMIONE GRANGER and is already wearing her school robes. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#HERMIONE "> Has anyone seen a toad? A boy named Neville has lost one. <stage>(seeing
     Ron's wand) </stage> Oh, are you doing magic? Let's see then. <stage> She sits down. Ron looks
     a bit taken aback, but clears his throat nonetheless, poises his wand over Scabbers.
    </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#RON "> Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow, Turn this stupid. fat rat yellow. <stage>
     Scabbers SNORTS, but otherwise remains fat, grey, and asleep. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#HERMIONE "> Are you sure that's a real spell? Well, it's not very good, is it? I've
    only tried a few simple ones myself but they've all worked for me. For example ... <stage>To
     Harry' surprise, Hermione takes her wand, points it directly over his brow, then...
     stops.</stage> Goodness. You're Harry Potter, aren't you? I know all about you, of course. I
    was doing a little recreational reading and you're in Modern Magical History, The Rise and Fall
    of the Dark Arts and Great Wizarding Events of the 20th Century. </sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY "> Am I? </sp>
   <sp who="#HERMIONE "> Didn't you know? I'd have found out everything I could if it was me.
     <stage>(raising her wand) </stage> Anyway ... Oculus Reparo. <stage>Instantly, the cracked
     bridge of Harry's glasses is mended. </stage> There. That's better, isn't it? I'm Hermione
    Granger, by the way. And you are ... ? Â· <stage>Ron is still staring at the glasses, feeling a
     bit outdone. </stage>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#RON "> Um... Ron Weasley. </sp>
   <sp who="#HERMIONE "> Pleasure. Do either of you know what House you'll be in? I'm hoping for
    Gryffindor--I hear Dumbledore himself was in it--but I think I might just die if they put me in
    Slytherin. That was You-Know- Who' s House. Anyway, you two had better change into your robes. I
    expect we'll be arriving soon. You've got dirt on your nose, by the way, did you know? <stage>
     As she exits, Harry and Ron just sit, staring at the door. </stage></sp>
  </scene>
  <scene>
   <stage cat="EXT" where=". HOGSMEADE STATION - HOGWARTS - NIGHT "> As the scarlet engine HISSES to
    a stop, Harry and the others spill out. Harry's robes shimmer grandly, while Ron's secondhand
    silks show a bit too much sneaker. </stage>
   <sp who="#HAGRID"> Firs' years! Firs' years over here!<stage> Hagrid gives Harry a wink as he
     comes loping out of the darkness, swinging a LAMP. Ron, preoccupied with wiping his nose clean
     on his robes, stops, dumbstruck by Hagrid's size. </stage></sp>
  </scene>
  <scene>
   <stage cat="EXT" where=" BLACK LAKE - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER"> A FLEET of TINY BOATS glides
    silently over a glassy lake. Harry rides with Ron, Hermione and Neville Longbottom, gazing at
    the DARK TREES of the FOREST that surrounds them. A GLINT OF SILVER flickers through the black
    trees, like a dream. Harry watches, transfixed, then... </stage>
   <sp who="#HAGRID "> You there! Don' be trailin' yer fingers in the water. Yeh might find yeh don'
    get 'em all back. <stage> Harry turns, sees that Hagrid is speaking to a POINTY-FACED. BOY
     (DRACO MALFOY). Malfoy eyes Hagrid darkly, whispers to a PAIR OF THICK-LOOKING BOYS (CRABBE and
     GOYLE). Harry peers into the black water, sees his own pale face looking back, then a soft
     GLITTER of REFLECTED LIGHT dances on the surface. He looks up, watches a magnificent CASTLE
     drift into view. Hogwarts. </stage></sp>
  </scene>
  <scene>
   <stage cat="INT" where=" ENTRANCEHALL - HOGWARTS CASTLE - NIGHT "> Harry and the others enter a
    grand entryway lit with flaming torches. PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL, a rather severe-looking witch in
    an emerald cloak, stands before a pair of TOWERING DOORS. She lifts her chin, surveys the new
    students. </stage>
   <sp who="#MCGONAGALL "> Welcome to Hogwarts. In a moment, you will pass through these doors and
    join your classmates, but before you can take your seats,you must be sorted into your Houses.
    They are Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. While here, your House is, in many
    ways, your family. Your triumphs will earn your House points, while any rule-breaking will lose
    points. At the end of the year, the House with the most is awarded the House Cup, a great honor.
    I hope each of you...<stage> Just then, a rather LARGE TOAD springs forth, CROAKS. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#NEVILLE "> Trevor! <stage> Neville, blissfully relieved, gathers his toad, then peers
     up from the hem of Professor McGonagall's robes. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#MCGONAGALL"> ...will be a credit to whichever House becomes yours. The Sorting Ceremony
    will begin momentarily. <stage> Professor McGonagall glowers at Neville, then exits. As she
     goes, there is a BRIEF CLAMOR of SOUND from the students waiting in the Great Hall beyond.
    </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY "> How exactly do they sort us? </sp>
   <sp who="#RON "> Some kind of test, I think. Fred says it hurts like hell, but I'm sure he was
    joking. At least... I think he was. <stage> Just then, Draco Malfoy pushes through the crowd,
     shadowed by the boys from the boat. Malfoy stares openly at Harry's scar. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#DRACO  "> It's true then, what they were saying on the train. Harry Potter has come to
    Hogwarts. <stage>Harry's eyes slide, appraise the other two boys. </stage> Oh. This is Crabbe
    and Goyle. And my name's Malfoy. Draco Malfoy. <stage>Ron COUGHS, masking a snigger. Malfoy's
     eyes narrow. </stage> Think my name's funny, do you? No need to ask yours. Red hair, freckles,
    and a hand- me-down robe--you must be a Weasley. <stage>(to Harry)</stage> You'll soon find out
    some wizarding families are better than others, Potter. You don't want to go making friends with
    the wrong sort. I can help you there. <stage> Malfoy extends his hand, but Harry's gaze remains
     level. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY "> I think I can tell the wrong sort for myself, thanks. <stage> Malfoy's eyes
     glitter with rage. Finally he drops his hand, turns away. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#HERMIONE . "> Well, he's rather disagreeable, isn't he? <stage> Ron and Harry turn, see
     Hermione. Just then, Professor McGonagall returns. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#MCGONAGALL "> We are ready for you. </sp>
  </scene>
  <scene>
   <stage cat="INT" where=" GREAT HALL - NIGHT "> Harry and the others file into a strangely
    splendid place lit by THOUSANDS OF CANDLES FLOATING in midair over four long tables lined with
    students. Harry looks to the windows below the ceiling, finds glorious stars and an icy blue
    moon. </stage>
   <sp who="#HERMIONE "> It' s not real, the ceiling. It's only bewitched to look like the night
    sky. I read about it in Hogwarts, A History. <stage> Professor McGonagall sweeps to the front of
     the room where a WIZARD'S HAT--patched and frayed--sits on a stool. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#MCGONAGALL "> Before we begin, Professor Dumbledore would like to say a few words.
     <stage> Harry watches with great interest as the great wizard himself rises from his seat at
     the High Table. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE "> Yes, and here they are: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak! Thank you!
     <stage> The Great Hall THUNDERS with APPLAUSE. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#HERMIONE "> I hear he's a genius. <stage> As the applause subsides, the hat TWITCHES.
     At the brim, a rip OPENS WIDE, and the hat begins to TALK. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#SORTINGHAT  "> Oh, you may not think I'm pretty But don't judge on what you see I'll
    eat myself if you can find A smarter hat than me. There' s nothing hidden in your head The
    Sorting Hat can't see So try me on and I will tell you Where you ought to be.... <stage> As the
     students APPLAUD, the hat takes a bow and Professor McGonagall steps forward with a ROLL OF
     PARCHMENT. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#MCGONAGALL "> When I call your name, you will come forth, put on the hat and be sorted.
     <stage>(consulting her list) </stage> Hermione Granger. </sp>
   <sp who="#HERMIONE "> Oh dear. Here it is, isn't it? The moment. Goodness. What if the hat says
    nothing and we're all just left standing here forever ... </sp>
   <sp who="#RON ">
    <stage>(as she goes mumbling off) </stage> Mental, that one. I'm telling you. <stage> Both watch
     Hermione seat herself, lower the Hat. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#SORTING HAT "> GRYFFINDOR! <stage> Percy pulls out a chair for Hermione at the
     Gryffindor table. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#MCGONAGALL "> Draco Malfoy. </sp>
   <sp who="#RON "> Slytherin. <stage> Draco Malfoy swaggers forth and grips the hat. He's barely
     touched it to his head, when: </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#SORTING HAT "> SLYTHERIN! </sp>
   <sp who="#RON">
    <stage>(off Harry's amazement) </stage> There's not a witch or wizard who went bad who wasn't in
    Slytherin. Draco's father was one of the first to join You-Know-Who when he got power. And one
    of the first to come back when he lost it. </sp>
   <sp who="#MCGONAGALL. "> Susan Bones. <stage> As SUSAN BONES dashes up front, Harry glances to
     the High Table. Dumbledore watches the proceedings placidly, while Professor Quirrell talks to
     a hook-nosed man with greasy black hair and sallow skin, PROFESSOR SNAPE. Slowly, as if he can
     feel Harry's gaze, Snape turns, looks straight into Harry's eyes. Instantly, a sharp, hot PAIN
     shoots across Harry's scar. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY "> Ouch! </sp>
   <sp who="#RON "> Harry? What is it? </sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY "> N-nothing. I'm fine. </sp>
   <sp who="#SORTING HAT "> Hufflepuff! <stage> As Susan Bones runs off... </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#MCGONAGALL "> Ronald Weasley. <stage> As Ron steps nervously away, Harry glances back
     to the High Table. Snape has returned to his conversation. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#SORTING HAT "> Gryffindor! <stage> Fred and George WHOOP LOUDLY as Ron comes grinning
     out of the hat, greatly relieved. Harry starts to clap himself when... </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#MCGONAGALL "> Harry Potter. <stage>There is an abrupt drop in the CHATTER. As Harry
     makes his way, he avoids the eyes of the many who stare and whisper. </stage> If you will, Mr.
    Potter. <stage> Harry sits, takes the hat, and... slowly... lowers it. He waits, then the hat
     begins to SPEAK. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#SORTING HAT "> Hmmm. Difficult. Very Difficult. Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad
    mind either. There's talent, oh yes, and a thirst to prove yourself. But where to put you...?
     <stage>Harry grips the edge of the stool, closes his eyes. His lips move ever so slightly: Not
     Slytherin. Not Slytherin.</stage> Not Slytherin, eh? Are you sure? You could be great, you
    know, it's all here in your head, and Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness, no doubt
    about that... No? Well, if you're sure... better be GRYFFINDOR! <stage> A ROAR erupts from the
     Gryffindor table. Harry stands shakily and walks to his table, where Percy, the Weasley twins,
     and Hermione all welcome him. At the High Table, Dumbledore lifts his goblet and, meeting
     Harry's eyes... nods. </stage></sp>
  </scene>
  <scene>
   <stage cat="INT" where=" GREAT HALL - LATER "> Freshly sorted and seated, the Gryffindor first
    years watch in amazement as the empty plates before them suddenly... fill with food. There is
    roast beef, chicken, pork chops, lamb chops, sausages, bacon, steak--the feast of all feasts.
    Harry listens as a rather wild-looking boy named SEAMUS talks to another student, DEAN THOMAS. </stage>
   <sp who="#SEAMUS "> I'm half and half. Me dad's a Muggle, Mam's a witch. Bit of a nasty shock for
    him when he found out. <stage> As Percy leans over to pour a strange liquid into Harry's goblet,
     Harry nods to the High Table, to Professor Snape. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY "> Say, Percy. Who's that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell? </sp>
   <sp who="#PERCY "> Hm? Oh. Professor Snape. Head of Slytherin House </sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY "> What's he teach? </sp>
   <sp who="#PERCY"> Potions. But everyone knows it's the Dark Arts he fancies. Been after
    Quirrell's job for years. <stage>Just then, several STUDENTS SHRIEK as a volley of GHOSTS stream
     into the hall overhead. One swoops down. </stage> Hello, Sir Nicolas. Have a nice summer? </sp>
   <sp who="#NEARLY HEADLESS NICK "> Dismal. What with the Slytherins winning the House Cup six
    years in a row, the Bloody Baron's become unbearable. <stage>Nick nods his head in the direction
     of the Slytherin table, where a horrific, BLOOD-STAINED GHOST hovers imperiously. </stage> Then
    again, he's always been unbearable. </sp>
   <sp who="#RON  "> I know you. You're Nearly Headless Nick. </sp>
   <sp who="#NEARLY HEADLESS NICK "> I prefer Sir Nicolas, if you don't mind. </sp>
   <sp who="#HERMIONE "> Nearly headless? How can you be nearly headless? </sp>
   <sp who="#NEARLY HEADLESS NICK "> Like this. <stage> Seizing himself by the left ear, Nick swings
     his ENTIRE HEAD off his neck and onto his shoulder, as if it were on a hinge. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#NEVILLE ">
    <stage>(blanching) </stage> I think I'm done eating. <stage> Just then, Dumbledore rises at the
     High Table. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE "> If I may, I have a few start-of-term notices to announce. First Years
    should note that the Dark Forest is strictly forbidden to all pupils. Also, our caretaker, Mr.
    Filch has asked me to remind you that... <stage>FILCH, a sour-looking man, stands near a side
     exit while MRS. NORRIS, a cat with glittering REDEYES, sits by his feet. </stage> ... no magic
    should be used between classes in the corridors. And finally, please note that this year, the
    third floor corridor on the right hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to
    die a most painful death. <stage>Hearing this, Ron stops chewing for the first time, glances at
     Harry. But before either can speak...</stage> And now, let us sing the school song! Everyone
    pick their favorite tune and off we go! <stage>Professor McGonagall rolls her eyes slightly as
     Dumbledore wields his wand. Consulting the PARCHMENT of LYRICS placed beside their plates,
     Harry and his fellow First Years join a rousing, but rather dischordant, chorus of VOICES.

   <sp who="#PERCY "> This is the most direct path to the dormitory, except on Fridays, of course,

   <stage cat="INT" where="7TH FLOOR CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT"> ...a new corridor. Up ahead,
    Harry spies a bundle of WALKING STICKS floating in midair. Without warning, the walking sticks
    come flying forth. As the First Years duck and dodge, Percy sighs in annoyance. </stage>
   <sp who="#PERCY "> Gryffindors, I givee you Peeves, Hogwarts resident poltergeist<stage> POP! A

   <sp who="#MCGONAGALL "> Thank you for that assessment, Mr. Weasley. But perhaps it might be more

    Dark wizards or witches unknown, Gringotts goblins, while acknowleging the breach, insist
    nothing was taken. The vault in question had, in fact, been emptied earlier that very same day.'
    That's odd. </sp>
   <sp who="#RON "> It's mad. Dad says there are dragons guarding some of the vaults. </sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY "> No. It's just odd... That's the day Hagrid and I were there. </sp>
  </scene>
  <scene>
   <stage cat="EXT" where=" THE GROUNDS - HOGWARTS - DAY  "> Harry stands in a cluster of
    Gryffindors, across from Malfoy and his Slytherin cronies. Between them, there is a LONG LINE OF
    BROOMSTICKS. MADAME HOOCH, a rangy witch with short grey hair and hawk-like eyes, stands between
    the two groups. </stage>
   <sp who="#MADAME HOOCH "> Welcome to your first Flying Lesson. Well, what are you all waiting
    for? Everyone step up to a broomstick. Come now. Hurry up. <stage>Harry steps forward nervously,
     glances down. His broom is old, with twigs sticking out at odd angles. </stage> Stick out your
    right hand, over the broom, and say "Up"! <stage>SHOUTS of "Up!" ring on the cold afternoon air.
     Though he barely WHISPERS the command, Harry's broom SNAPS smartly into his hand. Hermione's
     simply rolls over. Ron's FLIES UP and CRACKS HIM IN THE NOSE.</stage> Now. Once you've got hold
    of the broom, I want you to mount it. And grip it tight. We don't want you sliding off the end.
     <stage>(walking the row) </stage> Your other right hand, Mr. Finnegan. Goodness, boy, what have
    you done with your eyebrows? </sp>
   <sp who="#SEAMUS "> Lost 'em, ma'am. </sp>
   <sp who="#DRACO"> Excuse me, Madam Hooch. Given that a few of us have been on sticks for years,
    would it not make sense to separate the expert flyers from... <stage>(glancing at Harry)</stage>
    the neophytes? </sp>
   <sp who="#MADAME HOOCH "> Thank you, Mr. Malfoy, but I'm sure even an expert flyer such as
    yourself can appreciate the benefits of reacquainting oneself with the basics. Your grip, for
    example. It's thumb in, not out. <stage>As Malfoy reddens, Harry and Ron share a grin. </stage>
    Very well. Now when I blow my whistle, I want each of you to kick off from the ground. Hard.
    Keep your brooms steady, hover for a moment, then lean forward slightly and touch back down. On
    my whistle...Three ... Two ... <stage>Jumping the gun entirely, a nervous Neville shoots
     straight up into the air, like a cork out of a bottle. </stage> Mr. Longbottom! Exactly where
    do you think you're going? <stage>Clutching desperately to his broom, Neville caroms crazily off
     a tree, flops upside down, rockets past the other students--who duck--then soars into a mad
     spiraling climb. </stage> Come down here this instant! <stage>Neville's pale face peers down,
     his eyes roll up...</stage> On your broomstick, Longbottom! <stage>Too late. With a giant THUD
     and a nasty CRACK, Neville hits the pitch. Madame Hooch and the Gryffindors rush over. </stage>
    Broken wrist. Corne on, dear. Up you get. <stage>(leading him off) </stage> Everyone's to keep
    their feet on the ground while I take Mr. Longbottom to the Hospital Wing. Understand? If I see
    a single broom in the air, the one riding it will find themselves out of Hogwarts before they
    can say 'Quidditch.' <stage>As they go, Harry watches Neville's broom sail high over Hagrid's
     house, where the giant himself sits in the front garden, watching with a pair of BINOCULARS.
     Malfoy scoops Neville's Remernbrall from the grass, cackles. </stage>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#DRACO"> Did you see his face? Perhaps if the great lump had given this a squeeze, he
    would've remembered to fall on his fat arse. </sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY "> Give it here, Malfoy. </sp>
   <sp who="#DRACO "> No, I think I'll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find. How about up a
    tree? <stage>Malfoy slings a leg over his broom, KICKS into the air. </stage> What's the matter,
    Potter? A bit beyond your reach? <stage>Harry glowers up at Malfoy, then GRABS his broom.
    </stage>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#HERMIONE "> Harry! No! You heard what Madame Hooch said. Besides you don't even know
    how to fly. <stage> Harry shoots into the sky, so angry that it's a moment before he realizes
     what the others see clearly: he's a natural. Turning his broomstick sharply, he hovers, glaring
     at Malfoy. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY "> Give it here. Or I'll knock you off that ruddy broom. </sp>
   <sp who="#DRACO "> Is that so? <stage>Harry SHOOTS forth like a javelin, Malfoy just managing to
     slip his charge. As Harry whips around, Malfoy glances down at the ground, clearly unnerved.
     Harry simply smiles. </stage> Have it your way, then! <stage>Malfoy hurls the ball high. As it
     plummets, Harry throws himself into a steep dive, rocketing recklessly downward, ignoring the
     earth as it rushes toward him, extending his hand and snatching the ball only feet from the
     ground. He lands running, grinning, as the Gryffindors CHEER. Then...</stage>

    the door. Trembling, she peers upward... watching as... the troll's face appears over the top,
    looking in. Panicked, she drops to the floor and shimmies into the next stall, out of sight~
    Angered, the .troll rai~es its club and- SMASH!--shatters the stall Hermione just vacated. As
    wood rains down in jagged, splintered pieces... Harry and Ron rush in, staring in horror as the
    troll raises the club high and SHATTERS the next stall. Hermione, still crawling, covers her
    head and peers back. SMASH! The club comes thundering down yet again, this time just inches from

     grab anything they can and begin to hurl it at the troll, but they might as well be throwing
     marshmallows. As shards of wood bounce off its pint-sized head and great lumpy shoulders, the
     troll brings the club down once more and SHATTERS the last stall. As Harry and Ron look on
     grimly, the troll jabs its club into the hash of wood before it, poking about for Hermione,
     when, at the last second... ... she scrambles out and dashes under the sink. GRUNTING
     furiously, the troll turns, begins-to advance on her. Harry, thinking fast, rushes forward and
     leaps upon the troll's rising club... rising himself... right out of FRAME... and then...
     dropping... ... right onto the troll's slimy neck. The troll blinks dimly and, before it can
     react, Harry--purely on instinct--shoves his wand straight up the troll's nose. The troll ROARS
     in pain, dropping the club and stamping about. Ron watches helplessly, then glances at the club
     on the floor, an idea flickering across his face. Raising his wand, he SPEAKS: </stage>
    Wingardium Leviosa. <stage>Harry swings around, sees Ron standing, wand poised. It does not
     inspire confidence. Ron looks at Hermione, takes a breath, and this time, employs the correct
     pronunciation. </stage> Wingardium LEVI-OHHHH-SA! <stage> With that, the club quivers upon the
     floor... begins to rise. The troll, still raging, grabs Harry's leg and peels him off his body.
     As he holds Harry up high, suspended by one leg, Harry's world goes upside down, spinning,
     when... ... the club floats by his face. The troll pauses, watching in confusion as the club
     rises toward the ceiling, hanging in magical suspension until ... ... THUNK! It drops smack on
     the troll's head. Wobbling, the troll releases its grip on Harry's leg and... ... drops him
     hard to the floor. Harry peers up. The troll wobbles one last time and starts to fall...
     directly on top of Harry. Quickly, Harry rolls away... ... just before the troll SLAMS to the

   <sp who="#HERMIONE "> But why would anyone go near that dog? </sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY"> Listen. The day I was at Gringotts, Hagrid took something out of one of the
    vaults. Said it was Hogwarts business. Very secret. </sp>
   <sp who="#HERMIONE"> So you're saying... </sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY"> That's what the dog's guarding. That's what Snape wants. </sp>
   <sp who="#RON "> But what's safer than Gringotts? </sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY "> One place, according to Hagrid. Hogwarts. </sp>
   <sp who="#HERMIONE "> Well, whatever it is, it must be really valuable. </sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY "> Or really dangerous. <stage> Just then, an OWL beats into the room.
    </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#HERMIONE"> Bit early for mail, isn't it? </sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY "> That's Hedwig. <stage>All watch as she swoops down with a LONG, THIN PACKAGE.
     Harry slips Hedwig a piece of his uneaten toast, strips open the parcel and finds, inside, a
     sleek mahogany BROOMSTICK. </stage> It's a broomstick. </sp>
   <sp who="#RON  "> That's not a broomstick, Harry. That's a Nimbus Two Thousand. </sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY "> But who...?<stage> Harry glances up, sees--far across the room--Professor
     McGonagall looking his way. Quickly, she turns away. </stage></sp>

  <scene>
   <stage cat="EXT" where=" QUIDDITCH FIELD - DAY "> The stadium is full. Ron and Hermione join
    Neville and Seamus in the Gryffindor section, unfurl a banner that reads POTTER FOR PRESIDENT.
    As the Slytherin and Gryffindor teams take the field, the CROWD ROARS. Oliver Wood runs up
    alongside a nervous Harry, who clutches his new Nimbus 2000. </stage>
   <sp who="#WOOD "> I know what you'ree thinking, Harry. I'm playing my first game of Quidditch,
    the entire school's watching me and, worst of all, it's against Slytherin. Am I right? </sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY "> Pretty close. </sp>
   <sp who="#WOOD "> It' s all right. I felt the same way before my first game. </sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY "> What happened? </sp>
   <sp who="#WOOD "> I don't really remember. I took a Bludger to the head about two minutes in and
    woke up in the hospital week later. <stage> Madame Hooch, clad in REFEREE ROBES, addresses the
     players. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#MADAMEHOOCH "> Now, I want a nice clean game. From all of you. <stage> She glances
     tellingly at Slytherin Captain MARCUS FLINT. Harry leans over to ANGELINA JOHNSON, Gryffindor
     Chaser. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY "> Who's he, Angelina? </sp>
   <sp who="#ANGELINA "> Marcus Flint. Slytherin Captain. They say he's got troll blood in him.
     <stage> Harry swallows as Flint glares at him murderously. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#MADAME HOOCH "> Mount your brooms, please. <stage> Hands trembling, Harry waits,
     then... the WHISTLE BLASTS. FOURTEEN BROOMSTICKS rise into the air. As the crowd ROARS, Madam
     Hooch kicks the crate, releasing two SCREAMING Bludgers, then tosses up the Quaffle. In the
     stands, LEE JORDAN does COMMENTARY. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#LEE JORDAN "> Quaffle's up... and straight off taken by Angelina Johnson of Gryffindor.
    What an excellent Chaser that girl is, and rather attractive too, I might add... <stage>
     Professor McGonagall casts a disapproving glance at Jordan, then turns to watch the action
     below. Cradling the Quaffle, Angelina Johnson WEAVES wickedly past a Slytherin Chaser, DUCKS
     UNDER a sizzling Bludger that Fred Weasley CHIPS AWAY, then DISHES OFF to a speeding Alicia
     Spinnet. Alicia FALLS into a FIFTEEN FOOT ROLLING DIVE, feeds the Quaffle back to Angelina...
     but has it INTERCEPTED by a slashing Marcus Flint. Flint FLIES FAST for the hoop, rears back...
     but has his shot BLOCKED by Oliver Wood. Wood bumps the Quaffle to Chaser Katie Bell, who
     ROCKETS past Flint the length of the field... only to take a Bludger to the back of the head.
     As the Quaffle pops loose, Marcus Flint grabs it, drives with astonishing speed-back the other
     way, then takes a Bludger himself, courtesy of George Weasley. Angelina Johnson swoops down,
     snatches the spinning Quaffle and, flying like lightning, races the field to score. As
     Gryffindor CHEERS fill the cold air, Hagrid makes his way up the stands, scattering students in
     his wake. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#HAGRID "> Budge up there. Clear the way.How's Harry holdin' up? <stage> Ron and
     Hermione squeeze together, giving Hagrid space. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#RON "> He hasn't had much to do yet. </sp>
   <sp who="#HAGRID"> First game. He stays outta trouble, that'll be doin' enough. <stage> Above the
     pitch, Slytherin's ADRIAN PUCEY eludes two Bludgers, two Weasleys and the Chaser, ZOOMING
     toward the goals... when suddenly a FLASH OF GOLD zips by his left ear. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY "> The Snitch!</sp> 
   <stage>Far below, Slytherin Seeker TERENCE HIGGS makes his move. Harry
    DIVES. Faster than Higgs, he closes the gap quickly, eyes locked on the tiny golden ball. He
    adds some speed, reaches out, and--WHAM!--Marcus Flint HITS HIM full on, sending him reeling.
    Harry PULLS UP his tip, LEVELS-OFF,and glances about. But the Snitch is GONE.</stage> 
   <sp who="#RON #HERMIONE #HAGRID"> FOUL! FOUL! FOUL! <stage> As a Bludger screamspast Harry, he
      tries to kick his broom higher. Instead, it LURCHES, nearly tossing him off. Below, Hagrid
      peers through his BINOCULARS, frowns. </stage></sp>
    <sp who="#HAGRID "> Dunno what Harry thinks he's doin'. If I didn't know better, I'd say he's
     lost control of his broom... </sp>
    <sp who="#RON "> Maybe something happened to it when Flint blocked him. <stage> In the stands,
      people gasp as the broom ROLLS OVER and leaves Harry DANGLING from one end. Neville buries his
      face. </stage></sp>
    <sp who="#HAGRID "> No. Can't nothin' interfere with a broomstick except powerful Dark magic. No
     kid could do that to a Nimbus 2000. <stage> Hearing this, Hermione GRABS Hagrid's binoculars.
     </stage></sp>
    <sp who="#HERMIONE ">
     <stage>(whispering to Ron) </stage> It's Snape. He's jinxing the broom. <stage> Ron takes the
      binoculars, looks. Snape sits MUTTERING in the opposite stands, staring into the sky. Staring
      at Harry. </stage></sp>
    <sp who="#RON "> Jinxing the broom? What do we do? </sp>
    <sp who="#HERMIONE "> Leave it to me. As Hermione dashes off, Ron turns the binoculars back to
     the sky. Harry hangs from the broom with two hands while Fred hovers nearby. George circles
     about ten feet below. </sp>
    <sp who="#HARRY "> What's George doing? </sp>
    <sp who="#FRED "> Just in case you fall, George will... <stage>(not sure of this himself)
     </stage> ... catch you. </sp>
    <sp who="#HARRY "> I knew I should have gone out for football. </sp>
    <sp who="#GEORGE "> What's football? <stage> Hermione fights her way through theSlytherin
      faithful, who cackle at Harry's plight, toward Snape. </stage></sp>
    <sp who="#DRACO "> Take a good look, lads. With any luck we'll be having Potter soup for supper.
      <stage> Just then, Hermione brushes past, sending Malfoy ass over tea kettle into Professor
      Quirrell in the row below. Reaching Snape, Hermione crouches down and whips out her wand.
      Across the field Ron peers through the binoculars ... </stage></sp>
    <sp who="#RON "> Come on, Hermione...<stage> Just then, BLUE FLAMES spit from Hermione's wand,
      climbing quickly up Snape's robes. Snape continues to mutter, staring skyward, then realizes
      he's on fire, and looks away. In the commotion, that ensues, Ron sees Hermione scoop the blue
      fire into a little jar, slip it into robe, and make her escape. Instantly, Harry's broom stops
      jerking. He clambers back on, when--SWOOSH!--A FLASH OF GOLD streaks by him: the Snitch. Higgs
      ZOOMS UP from below and he and Harry give chase. The Snitch SWERVES, then... DIVES. As it
      PLUMMETS, Harry and Higgs plummet too, giving it all they've got. On the pitch below, Hermione
      puts her hand to her mouth. In the stands, Neville buries his head again. As the Snitch drops,
      the ground rushes crazily upward, the speed breathtaking. Harry seems intoxicated by it,
      slightly crazed, eyes riveted to the fluttering Snitch, seeing it and only it. Higgs, on the
      other hand, sees only the ground and, at the last minute, can bear it no longer, PULLING UP on
      his broom-and SWERVING to safety. As Harry and earth collide, the Nimbus cartwheels away,
      Harry rolls off and, coming up on all fours, claps his hand to his mouth. As if he were sick.
     </stage></sp>
    <sp who="#MCGONAGALL"> Well, that's unfortunate. Understandable, but unfortunate. <stage> As
      Harry COUGHS, Hagrid takes back his binoculars, which,unfortunately for Ron, are still-around
      Ron's neck. </stage></sp>
    <sp who="#HAGRID "> Unfortunate nothin'. He's got the Snitch! <stage> Harry SHOOTS his hand in
      the air. The crowd ROARS. Marcus Flint touches down, fuming. </stage></sp>
    <sp who="#FLINT "> He didn't catch it. He swallowed it!. </sp>
    <sp who="#HERMIONE ">
     <stage>(popping in) </stage> Nothing in the Quidditch rulebook discriminates against catching
     the Snitch in your mouth. Or any other place for that matter. In fact, in a game played in
     Greece in the late seventeenth century- </sp>
    <sp who="#MADAMEHOOCH "> Thank you, Miss Granger. We can dispense with the more unattractive
     historical details of the game. Nevertheless, your point is well taken. Match to Gryffindor!
      <stage>As Harry's teammates lift him to their shoulders, Hermione spies Snape in the far
      stands, limping quickly away, hisrobes still smoking. </stage>

   <sp who="#HAGRID "> Now listen to me, all three of yeh-- yer meddlin' in things that shouldn't be

     DROOLING SHADOW darkens their faces. Fluffy. Awake. Hungry. Each head ponders its own

     into the darkness... </stage></sp>

    chamber where hundreds of JEWEL BRIGHT BIRDS flutter below a high arching ceiling. On the
    opposite side is a HEAVY WOODEN DOOR and, floating in the center of the chamber, a single
    BROOMSTICK. Ron and Hermione begin to cross to the door, gazing in wonder at the strangely
    beautiful creatures overhead. </stage>
   <sp who="#HERMIONE "> Curious. I've never seen birds like these... </sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY "> They're not birds... <stage>Ron and Hermione turn, see Harry standing by the
     floating broom in the center of the room, looking up. </stage> They're keys. And I'll bet one

   </sp>
   <sp who="#HERMIONE "> Locked. </sp>
   <sp who="#RON "> Alohomora! <stage>Hermione turns, sees Ron waving his wand at the knob. No good.
     It's still locked. He shrugs. </stage> Well, it was worth a try. </sp>
   <sp who="#HERMIONE ">
    <stage>(peering up)</stage> So what do we do? There must be a thousand keys up there... </sp>
   <sp who="#RON ">
    <stage>(examining the lock)</stage> We're looking for a big, old-fashioned one--probably silver,
    like the handle. There! That one, see! With the bright blue wings! <stage> Ron points.
     Fluttering within a pocket of brass keys is a larger, SILVER one. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#HERMIONE "> What's wrong with its wing? </sp>
   <sp who="#RON "> The feather's pinched. Probably from Snape catching it before us. <stage>
     Hermione nods, sees Harry still staring at the broom. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#HERMIONE "> Harry? </sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY "> It's... too simple. </sp>
   <sp who="#RON "> Oh, go on, Harry. If Snape could catch it on that old CleanSweep, you can. It's
    not for nothing you're the youngest Seeker in a Century. <stage>Harry nods uncertainly--still
     troubled--but slowly reaches out nonetheless. As his fingers touch the broomstick... ...the
     KEYS EXPLODE IN A FRENZY, hissing like wasps, swarming in great, glittering clouds. Ron's smile
     droops. </stage> Well,this complicates things a bit. <stage>As Harry kicks into the air, a
     seething cluster of keys falls like HARD RAIN, CHATTERING at his arms and legs, SLICING at his
     skin, SHREDDING his sweater...</stage> He'll be torn to pieces. <stage>Horrified, Ron and
     Hermione watch Harry soar higher, fending off the keys with his free hand, until... HARRY'S POV
     Through a MAD CLATTERING, CLUSTER of KEYS, he spies the larger, silver one, fluttering only
     feet beyond his grasp. Harry hovers, grimacing as the hissing keys drop like DARTS onto his
     extended hand... then SNATCHES the silver key. Instantly, Harry whips downward in a wide,
     dizzying circle, trying to outrun the now furious keys. They shadow his every move, drawing
     closer and closer, HUMMING VICIOUSLY as they begin to CHIP at the TAIL TWIGS of the broom.
     Desperate, Harry throws the broom into a reckless dive and, steering with one hand... ...FLINGS
     the key to Ron. As Ron dashes to the door, Harry soars back up, taking the rging keys with him,
     then circles back and watches Ron JAM the key into the lock. As Hermione and Ron scurry
     through, Harry rockets straight after, the keys gaining once again, CHIPPING at the tail of
     broom like a buzzsaw through balsa wood. As the broom begins to WAFFLE, Harry gives one last
     BURST of SPEED and... SOARS through the open door. Together, Hermione and Ron FLING the door
     SHUT... just before the keys rain down like BULLETS. </stage>

     VAGUE SHAPES looming ahead. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY "> Where are we? A graveyard? <stage> Harry Steps forward and--suddenly--one of
     the SHAPES moves towards them. Hermione GASPS. The SHAPE stops. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#RON "> This is no graveyard... <stage>Ron takes an unlit torch from the wall, touches
     it to the blue flames fluttering in Hermione's palms, and kneels. As he paints the floor with
     light, a SPARK SPITS from the torch and ignites a trail of FIRE. </stage> It's a chessboard.
     <stage>Sure enough. As the chamber glows with light, a kind of battlefield is revealed, studded
     with faceless soldiers.</stage>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#HERMIONE "> But what're we to do? <stage> As Hermione takes a tentative step onto the
     board, a BISHOP'S STONE SWORD drops heavily down, barring her way. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#RON "> It's obvious, isn't it? We've got to play our way across the room. Excuse me...
    are we meant to join you? <stage>(as the bishop nods). </stage> Brilliant. <stage>(to Harry,
     Hermione) </stage> Now don't be offended, but neither of you are particularly good at chess- </sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY"> Just tell us what to do. </sp>
   <sp who="#RON "> All right. Harry, you take the empty Bishop's square. Hermione--you'll be the
    Queenside castle. As for me... <stage>Ron leaps astride the only riderless horse. </stage>
    ...I'll be a Knight. </sp>
   <sp who="#HERMIONE "> What happens now? </sp>
   <sp who="#RON "> We play. <stage> Across the board, a WHITE PAWN moves forward two squares (e4)
     As Ron contemplates his own move, Hermione glances apprehensively at the fierce pieces across
     the board. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#HERMIONE "> Ron, you don't suppose this is going to be like real wizard's chess, do
    you? <stage> Ron--contemplating something--doesn't answer immediately, instead gesturing to his
     own pawn. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#RON "> You there... d5 <stage>As Ron's BLACK PAWN obliges, WHITE'S PAWN slides swiftly
     forth (to d5) and, with a THUNDEROUS collision, the black pawn EXPLODES, rubble raining to the
     ground. </stage> Yes, Hemione. I think this is going to be exactly like wizard's chess.
     <stage>Dissolve to: .... the chess board, a real battlefield now, littered on both sides with
     fallen pieces. Ron, drained but intense, surveys the board, MUTTERING to himself. </stage>
    Think...Think... <stage>(deciding) </stage> Castle to... c3 <stage> The BLACK CASTLE advances.
     Instantly, the WHITE QUEEN sweeps forward and, with cruel indifference, SHATTERS the Rook.
     Harry, only one square removed, stares with horror. Unnerved, he glances up at Ron, but Ron's
     eyes see only the board. Harry turns, taking a look himself... and blinks. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY "> Wait a minute... <stage>(pointing to the Queen)</stage> She's made the same
    mistake I always make. If I go there, she has to take me, and the Ring is exposed! <stage> Ron
     nods, but it's clear he doesn't share Harry's enthusiasm. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#RON "> There's just one problem with that. It's you that has to go on, Harry. I know
    it. Not me. Not Hermione. You. </sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY "> No, Ron... </sp>
   <sp who="#HERMIONE "> What is it? </sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY "> He's going to sacrifice himself. </sp>
   <sp who="#HERMIONE"> No. There has to be another way! </sp>
   <sp who="#RON "> Do you want to stop Snape from getting the Stone or not! <stage>(turning to
     Harry) </stage> You understand, right, Harry? Once I make my move, the Queen will take me. Then
    you're free to check the King. <stage> Harry stares at Ron--an understanding between them--then
     simply nods. Ron grips the reins then and, without a word, drives his horse forward (Nh3).
     Instantly, the White Queen POUNCES. As Ron hits the floor, Hermione SCREAMS She starts to go to
     him, when Harry holds up his hand. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY"> No! <stage>(as she freezes)</stage> Don't forget we're still playing.
     <stage>Hermione nods, staring at Ron. Harry steps forward. (Bc5). The WHITE QUEEN moves to
     block (Qe3), but it's futile. Harry stares at her, eyes full of hatred, then steps forward,
     places his trembling hand on the cold stone of her gown and, with the gentlest of shoves...
     topples her. </stage>
    <stage>(softly) </stage> Checkmate. <stage>As a veil of dust hovers, the white king removes his
     CROWN, lets it roll from his fingers, across the stone floor, where it comes to rest at Harry's
     feet. Harry stares at Hermione' s stricken face. </stage> If you can, go to the owlery and send
    a message to Dumbledore. Ron's right. I have to go on. <stage> Hermione turns, her eyes
     glittering. Without warning, she rushes forward, embraces Harry. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#HERMIONE "> You're a great wizard, Harry Potter! You are, you know! </sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY ">
    <stage>(a bit embarrassed)</stage> Not as good as you. </sp>
   <sp who="#HERMIONE "> Me! Books. And cleverness. There are more important things--friendship and
    bravery and--oh, Harry, be careful! <stage> She turns then, goes to Ron. Harry studies his two
     friends, then looks away. The remaining chessmen bow, parting the way to the next door. He
     steps forward. </stage></sp>

   <stage cat="INT" where=" THE LAST CHAMBER - NIGHT"> Harry descends a staircase. As the chamber
    below comes into view, he sees a FIGURE standing before the Mirror of Erised. </stage>
   <sp who="#HARRY. "> You! <stage>The figure turns. It is Professor Quirrell.</stage> No. It can't
    be. Snape... </sp>
   <sp who="#QUIRRELL "> Mm, yes, he does seem the type, doesn't he? So useful Snape. Swooping
    around like an overgrown bat. Next to him, who would suspect p-poorr st- stuttering Professor
    Quirrell? </sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY"> But that day, during the Quidditch match... Snape to kill me. </sp>
   <sp who="#QUIRRELL"> No, dear boy, I tried to kill you. And, trust me, if Snape's cloak hadn't
    caught fire and broken my eye contact, I would've succeeded. Even with Severus muttering his
    little countercurse. </sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY "> Snape was trying to save me? </sp>
   <sp who="#QUIRRELL"> Oh, don't misunderstand. He hates you, just as he hated your father when
    they were at Hogwarts together. But he never wanted you dead. Your father, after all, saved his
    life once, long ago. <stage>Harry looks stunned. Quirrell looks amused. </stage> Didn't know?
    Surprising, given how curious you are Potter. I knew you were a danger to me right off.
    Especially after Halloween. </sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY "> You let the Troll in. <stage> Quirrell nods, examining the Mirror as he
     speaks: </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#QUIRRELL"> Yes. I have a way with trolls. Snape, unfortunately, wasn't fooled. While
    everyone else was running about the dungeons, he went straight to the Third Floor to head me
    off. That three headed dog didn't even manage to bite Snape's leg off properly. He of course,
    never trusted me again. Rarely left me alone.. But he doesn't understand. I am never alone.
    Never... <stage>(frowning)</stage> Now what does this mirror do? I see what I desire, I see
    myself holding the Stone. But how do I get it? </sp>
   <sp who="#VOICE">
    <stage>(O.S.) </stage> Use the boy. <stage> Harry glances about in horror as the DARK VOICE
     echoes. Quirrell turns, eyes Harry. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#QUIRRELL"> Come here, Potter <stage>Quirrell points to the mirror. As Harry steps in
     front, he sees himself, looking pale and scared. Then, slowly, his reflection SMILES, puts its
     hand in its pocket, and pulls out a BLOOD-RED STONE. Harry's own eyes widen--in a mixture of
     stunned disbelief and fear. Struggling to control his expression, he shuts his eyes briefly...
     as if making a wish... lets out a breath, and opens them once again. His reflection WINKS,
     returns the Stone to its pocket and, to Harry's amazement... ...it DROPS HEAVILY into his own:
     He's gotten the Stone. </stage>
    <stage>(studying him) </stage> What is it? What do you see? </sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY "> I... I'm shaking hands with Dumbledore. I... I've won the House cup. </sp>

    <stage>(O.S.)</stage> He lies. </sp>
   <sp who="#QUIRRELL"> Tell the truth! What do you see? </sp>
   <sp who="#VOICE">
    <stage>(O.S.)</stage> Let me speak to him. </sp>
   <sp who="#QUIRRELL"> Master, you are not strong enough. </sp>
   <sp who="#VOICE">
    <stage>(O.S.)</stage> I have strength enough... for this. <stage> Quirrell reaches up, unfurls
     his turban. In the mirror, Harry watches a FACE appear... on the back of Quirrell's head.
    </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY ">
    <stage>(in a whisper)</stage> Voldemort. </sp>
   <sp who="#VOLDEMORT "> Harry Potter. We meet... again. <stage>Petrified, Harry stares at the
     face. It is hideous, constantly changing, struggling to become whole. </stage> Yes. You see
    what I've become. Unicorn blood can sustain me, but it cannot give me a body of my own. But
    there is something that can. Something that, conveniently enough... lies in your pocket...
     <stage>Harry wheels, dashing toward the staircase.</stage> Stop him! <stage> Coolly, Quirrell
     SNAPS his fingers and, just as Harry reaches the threshold, FLAMES SHOOT from the floor,
     barring his way.</stage> Don't be a Â£ool, Harry. Why suffer a horrific death, when you can join
    me... and live. </sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY "> Never! </sp>
   <sp who="#VOLDEMORT "> Ah, bravery. Your parents had it too. Tell me, Harry... would you like to
    see your mother and father again? <stage>Harry stops, looks up. Quirrell steps aside,
     Voldemort's face sliding from the glass and revealing... Harry's parents. </stage> Together, we
    can bring them back. All I ask... is for something in return. <stage>Slowly, almost
     involuntarily, Harry removes the stone from his pocket. </stage> That's it, Harry. There is no
    good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to seek it. Together, we'll do
    extraordinary things. Just... give me the Stone. <stage> Harry studies his parents' faces,
     drifting to his mother's, when... we RACK FOCUS...and Voldemort's hideous face surfaces through
     her's... and she is gone. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY"> Liar! <stage> Voldemort's eyes narrow. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#VOLDEMORT "> Kill him! <stage> Instantly, Quirrell flies across the room, knocking
     Harry clean off his feet and the Stone tumbling from his grasp. Quirrell drops, his hand
     closing on Harry's neck. Harry winces at the touch, face creased in pain, looking up into
     Quirrell' s face, when... for the briefest of moments--it becomes Voldemort's. Harry gasps,
     struggling, when--to his amazement--Quirrell's own face returns, SCREAMING, releasing Harry and
     recoiling. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#QUIRRELL"> Wh-what is this magic? <stage> Harry, breathing hard, follows Quirrell's
     gaze, stares in horror: Quirrell's fingers are slowly turning to dust. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#VOLDEMORT"> Fool! Get the Stone! <stage> Harry rises, looks at Quirrell's withering
     fingers, then to his own hands, healthy and whole. As Quirrell starts to move, Harry, in the
     flash of a second... ...decides. He bolts forward, reaches up with both hands and... presses
     them to Quirrell's face. Quirrell SCREAMS, but Harry holds tight, growing weaker as the face
     under his fingers begins to DISSOLVE until, finally, just when Harry looks ready to pass out...
     Quirrell's face drops away. Harry staggers back. Quirrell's body steps forward, blindly
     lurching towards Harry, and then... crumbles to dust. Harry stands still, just staring, then
     turns wearily, picks up tbe Stone, when... an APPARITION--bearing Voldemort's devilish
     face--SWOOPS up behind. Harry spins, watching in terror as... WHOOSH!--in a VIOLENT RUSH--
     Voldemort returns to DUST and WHISTLES FORWARD, passing through Harry, blasting him back
     through the air and onto the stone floor. As the dust disappears, all is quiet once more, and
     we CUT TO: WIDE SHOT</stage> Of Harry. Lying on the floor. The Stone glimmering dully in his

    a raft of open WIZARD CARDS. In one, Dumbledore beams down. </stage>
   <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE"> Good afternoon, Harry. <stage>Harry squints, as if the card itself had

   <sp who="#HARRY "> Admirers? </sp>
   <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE "> What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is
    a complete secret--so naturally the whole school knows. Your friend Ronald has saved you the

   <sp who="#HARRY"> Ron was here? Is he all right? What about Hermione-- </sp>
   <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE"> Fine. Both of them. Madame Pomfrey has explicitly forbidden visitors. But
    I think--with the help of a certain cloak-- they've managed to monitor your progress. </sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY "> But what happened to the-- </sp>
   <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE "> Relax, dear boy. The Stone has been destroyed. My friend Nicolas and I
    had a little chat and agreed it was best all around. </sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY. "> But then, Flamel... he'll die, won't he? </sp>
   <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE "> He has enough Elixir to set his affairs in order. But, yes, he will die.
    To one as young as you, I'm sure it seems incredible. But to the well-organized mind, death is
    but the next great adventure. </sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY "> But to destroy such a remarkable thing... </sp>
   <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE "> Yes, yes. As much money and life as one could ever want--the two things
    most human beings would choose above all else. Unfortunately, humans do have a knack for
    choosing precisely those things that are worst for them. </sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY "> How is it I got the Stone, Sir? One minute I was staring in the mirror-- </sp>
   <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE "> Ah. You see, only a person who wanted to find the Stone--find it, but not
    use it-would be able to get it. One of my more brilliant ideas and, between you and me, that's
    saying something. </sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY "> Does that mean--with the Stone gone, that is--that Voldemort can never come
    back? </sp>
   <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE"> I'm afraid there are other ways for him to return. And when--if--he does,

    choice. <stage>Harry nods. Dumbledore studies him thoughtfully.</stage> Do you know why
    Professor Quirrell couldn't bear to touch you, Harry? It's because of your mother. She
    sacrificed herself for you. And that kind of act leaves a mark. <stage>Harry reaches up to his
     scar. </stage> No, this kind of mark cannot be seen. It lives in your very skin. It is the very

    think I'll be safe with a nice toffee. <stage>(popping it)</stage> Alas! Ear wax! </sp>
  </scene>

   <stage cat="INT" where=" MARBLE STAIRCASE - NIGHT "> As Harry limps down the staircase, he can
    hear the good cheer of those feasting beyond the doors of the Great Hall. Below, Hermione and
    Ron stand talking. Harry stops, simply studying them, then they turn, see him. Nothing is said
    for a moment. All of them beyond words. Then Harry nods to Ron's bruises. </stage>
   <sp who="#HARRY "> All right there, Ron? </sp>
   <sp who="#RON "> All right. You? </sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY "> All right. Hermione? <stage> She smiles. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#HERMIONE "> Never better. </sp>
  </scene>
  <scene>
   <stage cat="INT" where=" GREAT HALL - NIGHT "> The roaring Hall is bedecked in GREEN AND
    SILVER--Slytherin colors--in honor of their winning the House Cup. </stage>
   <sp who="#RON"> D'you think Dumbledore meant for it all to happen'? And for you to do it'?
    Sending you your father's cloak and all? </sp>
   <sp who="#HERMIONE "> Well,if he did-- I mean--that's terrible. You could have been killed. Come
    to think of it, I could've been killed... </sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY "> I think Dumbledore knows pretty much everything that goes on here. The only
    thing I don't understand is Snape... </sp>
   <sp who="#MCGONAGALL "> Professor Snape, Potter. <stage> Harry looks up, sees Professor
     McGonagall there. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY "> Yes, of course. I was only wondering. Is it true? Did he hate my father? </sp>
   <sp who="#MCGONAGALL "> They were not compatible personalities, if that's what you mean. And
    then, of course, your father did something Severus could never forgive. </sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY "> What was that? </sp>
   <sp who="#MCGONAGALL"> He saved his life. <stage>Astonished, Harry glances at Snape sitting at
     the High Table.</stage> I suppose he felt it his... obligation ...to look after you this year. </sp>
   <sp who="#RON "> Of course! And now that he's squared things, he can hate Harry in peace, right,
    Professor? </sp>
   <sp who="#MCGONAGALL "> Hogwarts teachers do not hate their students, Mr. Weasley...
     <stage>(pointedly, as she exits) </stage> No matter how taxing they may be. </sp>
   <sp who="#RON "> I think she's warming up to me. <stage> At the High Table, Dumbledore rises and
     the Hall quiets. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE"> Another year gone! Now as I understand it, the House Cup needs awarding,
    and the points stand thus: In fourth place, Gryffindor, with 312. <stage> Percy turns and glares
     at Ron. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#RON "> You'd think saving the bloody school from a Dark Lord would count for something. </sp>
   <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE "> In third place, Hufflepuff, with 352.In second, Ravenclaw, with 426. And
    in first place, with 472 points... Slytherin House. <stage>The Slytherin table erupts. Draco
     Malfoy, banging his goblet, casts a smirk at Harry, Ron and Hermione.</stage> Yes, well done,
    Slytherin. However, recent events must be taken into account. I have a few last minute points to
    award. <stage>The hall goes very STILL. The Slytherin smiles FADE a bit. </stage> First, to Miss
    Hermione Granger, for the cool use of intellect when others were in grave peril... fifty points.
     <stage>As the Gryffindors cheer, Hermione looks overwhelmed.</stage> Second, to Mr. Ronald
    Weasley, for the best played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in many years... fifty points. </sp>
   <sp who="#PERCY"> My youngest brother, you know! </sp>
   <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE "> Third, to Mr. Harry Potter, for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I
    award Gryffinder House... sixty points.<stage> The DIN is deafening as Hermione makes the
     calculations. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#HERMIONE "> Oh my goodness. We've tied Slytherin! </sp>
   <sp who="#DUMBLEDORE "> And finally... it takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our
    enemies, but even more to stand up to our friends. I therefore award 10 points to Mr. Neville
    Longbottom. <stage>As the room ROARS and the HOURGLASSES shift, a stunned Neville accepts wild
     slaps on the back. </stage> Assuming my calculations are correct, I believe a change of
    decoration is in order. <stage> Dumbledore CLAPS his hands and--instantly--the green and silver
     of Slytherin become the scarlet and gold of Gryffindor. Neville, white with shock, disappears
     under a pile of people hugging him. Draco Malfoy, looks stunned and horrified. Snape, with a
     horrible, forced smile, shakes Professor McGonagall's hand, then catches Harry's eye, his
     hatred still evident, but not enough to mar the moment. Harry considers the cheering faces that
     surround him, alone in the eye of a happy huricane. For a moment, he is not part of them, just
     watching. Then his voice joins the others, his face saying it all... This is a long way from
     the cupboard under the stairs. </stage></sp>
  </scene>
  <scene>
   <stage cat="EXT" where=" HOGSMEADE STATION - NEXT DAY - DAY "> The Hogwarts Express stands
    steaming, ready to depart. From the doorway, Ron calls to Harry, alone on the platform. </stage>
   <sp who="#RON "> Come on now, Harry. <stage> Harry glances about once more, then starts for the
     train. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#HAGRID "> Didn' think yeh'd be leavin' without sayin' goodbye, didya? <stage>Harry
     stops, smiles as Hagrid comes loping forward. Hagrid hands him a LEATHER-COVERED BOOK. </stage>
    That there's fer you to open on the train. Which seems to be leavin', by the way. <stage>Harry
     holds out his hand. Hagrid takes it, then pulls him into a rough hug. </stage> Go on now. An'
    Harry? If tha' dolt of a cousin o' yers Dudley gives yeh any grief, yeh can always threaten ter
    give 'im a pair o' ears ter go with that tail of 'is. </sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY "> But Hagrid. We' re not allowed to do magic away from Hogwarts. You know that. </sp>
   <sp who="#HAGRID "> I do... <stage>(a wink) </stage> But yer cousin don't. </sp>
  </scene>
  <scene>
   <stage cat="INT" where="TRAIN COMPARTMENT - DAY "> Ron half-dozes against the window, while
    Hermione does some "light reading." Harry sits opposite them, studying Hagrid's gift curiously.
    Then he opens it. Inside, the pages are filled with WIZARD PHOTOGRAPHS. Smiling and waving at
    Harry from every page are the faces he first saw in the Mirror of Erised. The faces of his
    mother and father. As the train lurches forward, Hermione looks up. </stage>
   <sp who="#HERMIONE "> Feels strange, doesn't it? To be going home. <stage> Harry traces his
     finger over the smiling face of his mother, then looks up, following Hermione's gaze to the
     window. </stage></sp>
   <sp who="#HARRY "> I'm not going home... Not really. </sp>
  </scene>
  <scene>
   <stage cat="EXT" where=" TRAIN -  MOVING AWAY - SAME TIME "> As Harry peers out, his face is
    calm. Peaceful. Hogwarts Castle glimmers in reflection on his window and we ... </stage>
   <stage>PULL AWAY ... rising high above Hogsmeade Station, above the Dark Forest and Hogwarts
    Castle itself as the Scarlet Express glitters far below, making its way back to the Muggle
    world. Slowly, we... FADE TO BLACK </stage>
